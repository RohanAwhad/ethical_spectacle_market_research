Analysis
What You Need to Know
Enterprises continue to move toward cloud operating model deployments, which are
transforming traditional data center architecture. In the 2023 Gartner CIO and Technology
Executive Survey, nearly half of CIOs stated that they intend to spend less on legacy
infrastructure and data center technologies. Half of CIOs in the same survey indicated
they plan to increase their investment in cloud operating platforms.1
The XaaS model is becoming more attractive to organizations for several reasons (see
How Do I Plan for Migrating my Data Center Infrastructure Into an XaaS Model?). The
gradual shifting of the control plane from on-premises to cloud-based, along with
increasing migration to SaaS, is driving a reduction in traditional data center infrastructure
footprints. XaaS is the bundling together of cloud computing services to create an
economical, easy-to-consume product for hybrid cloud environments. It is the result of the
disaggregation of traditional IT projects into components, domains and services that are
then bundled together for consumption.
Even with reduction of data center capacity requirements, the cost of refreshing on-
premises infrastructure can be high. As-a-service vendors can further reduce the enterprise
data center footprint by providing transitional services that replace the need for client
ownership and management of some applications and hardware. This model gives clients
the ﬂexibility and cost savings of outsourcing, while permitting the claim of operating in a
more eco-friendly mode when compared to inefﬁcient on-premises data center
infrastructure. It also gives organizations access to specialized skill sets through vendors
that are not easily obtainable in today’s market. Key drivers toward the adoption of as-a-
service models in the cloud are shown in Figure 1.

Strategic Planning Assumptions
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2027, 75% of organizations will implement a data
center infrastructure sustainability program driven by both cost optimization and in
response to stakeholder pressures, up from less than 5% in 2022.
Analysis by: Bob Gill, Jonathan Forest
Key Findings:
Market Implications:
Data center sustainability measures have been discussed for nearly two decades, but
much of the conversation has led to an obvious question: “Will sustainability of the data
center save the enterprise money?” In the absence of regulation or strong public pressures
to enforce sustainability measures, even environmentally sensitive enterprises have erred
on the side of reducing IT costs over social responsibility.
What has changed?Data centers consume roughly 1% of the world’s total electricity. Hyperscalers and
large colocation providers tend to be more energy-efﬁcient and further along in the
sustainability journey than the average enterprise.■
Increasing global energy insecurity and resultant rising variability in energy costs are
forcing data center planners and operators to improve energy efﬁciency and
resource management (such as water usage).■
Sustainable data center operations have been further driven into the forefront of
public awareness, due to huge data centers (such as for cloud) that continue to
expand in many metro areas.■
Progressive sustainability initiatives are growing in regions facing less governmental
scrutiny. There is now enough momentum in “green” energy infrastructure
technologies that such solutions will increasingly become cost comparable or
competitive with existing carbon-heavy solutions, and adoption will become
strategic and widespread.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00776956 Page 6 of 14
Public concerns about climate change and shareholder activism have driven enterprise
focus on sustainability from a desirable social posture to a board-level imperative. Data
center efﬁciency is an obvious target and opportunity for improvement. This is due to the
immense energy needs of operating such data centers, as well as public awareness of the
rapidly proliferating huge data centers (such as for cloud) on display in many major metro
areas. Rising energy costs and uncertainty over electricity supply have also driven
enterprises to evaluate their sustainability strategy. Implementing a data center
sustainability strategy will lead to more focus on optimizing energy usage, as well as offer
greater predictability on the cost side, which allows for better business planning.
The focus on sustainability has effects on technology planning and operations; for
example, energy pricing and regulations impact regional attraction for data hubs as much
as edge expansion and edge infrastructure (see Market Guide for Edge Computing).
Where data center facilities are offered as a service, such as via colocation, sustainability
has already become a major differentiator in the eyes of customers, and cannot be
dismissed without a negative impact on competitive position.

model, such that constant energy cost variability is buffered by the provider.■

Positioning I&O for Environmental Sustainability
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2027, migration to Xaas-based application offerings
will result in a 35% decline in enterprise-owned data center capacity when compared to
2022 levels.
Analysis by: Michael Warrilow, Philip Dawson
Key Findings:
Market Implications:
Cloud-ﬁrst policies will negate the majority of expansion of on-premises data center
infrastructure workloads. Replace scenarios will favor SaaS-based offerings rather than
rebuilding or rearchitecting. But ongoing migration of legacy business-critical workloads
will increasingly require dealing with large, proprietary/non-x86 workloads. This will
require IT projects and/or programs to migrate to a SaaS-based alternative. Alternatively,
for migration of custom enterprise applications, porting to a cloud-friendly processor (x86,
ARM) would be a necessary interim step.Data center compute and storage capacity does not reduce in lockstep with
workload migration. Various components of data center infrastructure can only be
decommissioned in increments (including rack space, cabling, power and cooling).■
I&O teams will face increased cost inefﬁciencies in the data center as a result of
ongoing lift and shift (to infrastructure as a service, or IaaS) and migration of critical
business workloads to SaaS and XaaS-based offerings. Challenges will include sunk
costs associated with existing asset life cycles, depreciation schedules, hosting and
sourcing arrangements.■
Migrating critical business workloads to SaaS- and XaaS-based offerings will result
in large, incremental reductions in the requirement for enterprise-owned data center
capacity.■
Long-term success in migration will necessitate coordination across multiple parts
of the organization, including I&O, facilities management/property, business unit IT,
sourcing, procurement and vendor management.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00776956 Page 8 of 14
But not all workloads can or will move to the cloud. Project- and program-based migration
will perpetuate piecemeal/gradual cloud migration that results in orphaned DC capacity.
For I&O leaders, this will result in increased scrutiny over data center infrastructure costs.
For the overall IT budget, SaaS migration will require I&O leaders to coordinate with
project and ﬁnance teams to address an increasingly “lumpy” shift from capital to
operational expenditure.

Market Implications:
On-premises workloads will become managed and controlled by the vendor’s “cloud-like”
approach, including management portals and the shift to subscription licensing (pay-as-
you-use and/or pay-as-you-go consumption models; see Notes section). An “IaaS-like”
approach from traditional noncloud providers will attempt to support modernization of on-
premises workloads and inhibit cloud migration. Regardless, these vendors are
increasingly moving toward cloud-based control planes, which also have technical
implications for most on-premises enterprise IT.
Integration of independent software vendor offerings, on top of the infrastructure, has
traditionally been through distinct vendor partnerships, integration platforms and/or
systems integrators. The traditional control of each workload has resulted in silos of
application management on top of common infrastructure, which are adequate for
tactical cloud migration (rehost/lift and shift).
By 2027, public and distributed cloud styles of management will inﬂuence the key control
points and management of remaining on-premises IT. A key beneﬁt is improved
operational efﬁciency, because cloud-inspired offerings inherently increase the vendor’s
sphere of responsibility for the offering. But it comes at the cost of an increase in
disparate, cloud-based control planes, which will cover different strata of the on-premises
environment with a greater degree of lock-in to each.Multiple control planes are emerging to control on-premises IT based on the
provider’s area(s) of strength and focus. Examples include control planes for data
center hardware, backup, network services, application and infrastructure.■
Multicloud adoption results in different cloud-based control planes from multiple
cloud providers. On-premises hardware and software offerings increasingly require
organizations to use cloud-based control planes.■
Control plane architectures are taking different approaches within their sphere of
inﬂuence. Integration with native/heterogenous functionality and/or ecosystems is
competing against initiatives to tightly couple the data plane.■
Hardware vendors are attempting to layer cloud-like platform solutions onto their
infrastructure (including Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Dell). Application and
platform vendors are offering distributed platforms that focus on the integration of
IaaS, platform as a service (PaaS) and/or SaaS (including Oracle, SAP and
Microsoft).■

The impact will be most signiﬁcant for organizations that require decentralized operation
and management (including support for air-gapped, remote/isolated and latency-sensitive
workloads). Multivendor/multilayer and/or multiecosystem cloud-based control planes
proliferate across hardware (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and application layers, which
perpetuates siloed operational processes, despite the appeal of a “single pane of glass.”

Market Implications:
According to Gartner’s 2021 Annual I&O Leaders Survey, it is no surprise that nearly every
enterprise is investing in SaaS, public cloud and infrastructure automation tools. But,
ironically, just over half are investing in the corresponding skills to take advantage of
those technologies.2 At the same time, over half of the respondents state that insufﬁcient
skills and resources are a major challenge for I&O. Leveraging tools without skills limits
the value of the tools, so there is a gap. This is often an oversight that needs to be
addressed by I&O organizations. In speaking with Gartner, clients often ask which skills
are needed, how to get started and how to acquire the skills.
Skills will increasingly be required to embrace cloud, support various application
architectures and as-a-service models, and enable automation. Some automation tooling
skills, such as Python scripting, Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef and Terraform are key. Along
with this, understanding the cloud infrastructure in various cloud service providers is
helpful in building out single and multicloud architectures. This also includes business
skills, as the transition from owning infrastructure to consuming it as a service changes
the responsibility from operating to more of a vendor management role. Operating
infrastructure was traditionally more of a technical discipline, but vendor management
includes adhering to SLAs, governance, cost models and overall business
metrics/outcomes.I&O organizations are struggling to build teams with the right skills, due to a ﬁnite
talent pool and because existing team members typically default to the old way of
doing business.■
In the rapidly changing data center infrastructure environment of today, not having
the right skills at the right time is a major inhibitor for I&O organizations and limits
the ability to take advantage of new technologies and business models.■
XaaS vendors can provide the necessary technical skills and automation to manage
speciﬁc aspects of client infrastructure to reinforce these speciﬁc areas of
weakness.■

Organizations should start small, as this is a journey. Don’t try to solve all problems at
once; build skills over time. Focus on building credibility through quick low-risk wins with
modest resources and build from there. Balance current operational needs with solving
these new challenges as part of an ongoing discipline. Hire talent with these new skills
and upskill existing employees where appropriate. If acquiring some technical skills
becomes a challenge or not desired, then investigate low code/no code options, as well as
SaaS and managed service providers.

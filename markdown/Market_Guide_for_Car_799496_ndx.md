Management
Carbon accounting and management is complex and requires
diverse and distributed data. Executive leaders must, therefore,
consider specialized software to meet regulatory requirements for
greenhouse gas reporting, and to enable enterprise progress on
net zero and GHG reduction targets.
Overview
Key Findings
The carbon accounting and management software market is fragmented and
immature, creating uncertainty and risk for buyers. Solution providers range from
pure-play startups with viability risk, to enterprise software and vendors from
adjacent markets. No vendor provides a complete solution.■
The environmental, social and governance (ESG) software and carbon accounting
markets are diverging instead of converging. This is due to regulatory pressures for
broad ESG coverage on the one hand, and deep specialization and focus to support
extended carbon use cases, such as product carbon footprints, on the other.■
Making progress on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments is an
enterprisewide endeavor that requires data and analytics tailored to the roles and
responsibilities that can take action.■
The business value of carbon accounting and management increases in tandem
with organization scope and complexity, regulatory demands and enterprise
environmental ambitions.■

Recommendations
Executive leaders that are evaluating the carbon accounting and management market
should:
Market Definition
Carbon accounting and management software facilitates data collection, analytics and
reporting of emissions data across all three scopes of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG
Protocol). These tools enable organizations to streamline and improve their reporting
capabilities. Advanced analytical capabilities also inform emissions reduction actions
and investments. “Carbon” is synonymous with the CO2 equivalent for all types of GHG
emissions.
Market Description
At a minimum, carbon accounting and management (see Note 1) supports the
identiﬁcation and collection of data needed to calculate and report on the enterprise’s
carbon footprint in compliance with the GHG Protocol,1 which deﬁnes three scopes for
emissions (see Figure 1):Identify and evaluate important use cases for carbon accounting and management
by collaborating with executives, sustainability teams and key functions including
supply chain, facilities, transportation and logistics, and energy procurement.■
Assess the type and depth of vendor solutions needed based on these drivers:
organization scale and complexity, regulatory intensity and enterprise sustainability
ambition.■
Establish a cross-functional team to identify relevant sources for carbon data by
taking industry differences and data sources into consideration. Use ﬁndings to
prioritize capabilities and evaluate vendor ﬁt.■
Evaluate vendors based on their strengths in GHG data collection, categorization,
calculation and emissions reduction planning; as well as alignment with your
material emissions sources. Ensure carbon accounting data can be extracted in the
event of the vendor’s failure to deliver solutions or their ﬁnancial collapse.■
Allocate sufﬁcient resources and time for a portfolio approach to sustainability
software composed of ESG software for broad issue coverage and overall reporting;
carbon accounting and management for emissions; and possible point solutions for
Scope 3 (indirect emissions).■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 3 of 21
Carbon accounting and management includes data from enterprise operations needed to
calculate Scope 1 direct emissions from owned or controlled sources and Scope 2 indirect
emissions from the generation of purchased energy. It also includes capabilities for
calculating Scope 3 emissions with actual emissions data from upstream activities and
partners — such as GHG emissions for a speciﬁc ﬂight taken for business travel. And it
includes acceptable estimates — such as emissions based on the amount spent for a
good or service.
Accurate Scope 3 data is generally not available for many categories, making estimates
necessary. There are a variety of acceptable methodologies for Scope 3 emissions
estimation. Executive leaders should direct their regulatory and compliance leaders to
consult the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation Guidance, as well as any detailed guidance
from relevant regulations for acceptable methodologies.2 They should also evaluate
vendor capabilities for adhering to acceptable methodologies.Scope 1 emissions come directly from organization-owned and -operated assets. ■
Scope 2 emissions are not emitted by the organization, but are directly associated
with the energy it procures to power its operations.■
Scope 3 emissions are those caused by associating with the business operations of
other entities in upstream and downstream value chains.■

Figure 1: GHG Emissions Scopes
Software that is sufﬁciently robust can collect and provide emissions data for additional
use cases such as estimating carbon footprint at the project or product level.
The GHG Protocol necessitates a signiﬁcant array of data in terms of diversity and
volume, sourced from various locations. These drivers have fueled the rapid formation
and growth of the market for carbon accounting and management software. This market
guide addresses the carbon accounting and management software market, which
provides a set of common capabilities (see Figure 2). Additional information on common
carbon accounting capabilities can be found in Note 2.

The range of organizations that are considering carbon accounting software is very broad
as the changes apply across all industries, including the public sector and education.
Carbon accounting is a fragmented, early market (prepeak, see  Hype Cycle for
Environmental Sustainability, 2023). The carbon accounting software market is in an
expansion phase and will likely remain fragmented for several years. Consolidation will
accelerate in the 2025 through 2027 time frame as some vendors will fail to meet
customer expectations, some vendors will be acquired and combined with other products
and services, and others will successfully scale to capitalize on rising demand. Enterprise
software vendors such as Microsoft and Salesforce will also continue to build out their
offerings and may acquire point solutions.
The limited carbon accounting capabilities available in the ESG software market are
insufﬁcient for enterprises interested in more complete coverage of their emissions,
especially with regard to Scope 3 emissions. At the same time, ESG software market
capabilities are broadening as buyers are under pressure to meet an increasing range of
material sustainability issues, including biodiversity, water, waste and social issues. These
broadening demands are pulling ESG software further apart from carbon accounting and
management, impeding consolidation. The separate, but related, climate risk assessment
and management market is also becoming a priority as regulators and ﬁnancial markets
push for more adequate disclosures and evidence of mitigation plans.
Market Analysis
There are four drivers fueling carbon accounting and management software evolution and
maturation:Goals and targets and the need to demonstrate progress, especially public
commitments to achieve net zero or carbon neutrality pledges made by executives■
Materiality: New demands from regulators, investors and large customers mean that
shortcomings in GHG data are starting to have greater ﬁnancial, legal and risk
implications than they did previously.■
Actionability: Concrete decarbonization measures call not only for better data in
passive carbon accounting, but also new decision-making capabilities to enable
active carbon management.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 7 of 21
In addition, developments in AI show some promise in helping to conquer the complexity
of carbon accounting. Drivers for carbon accounting also vary by industry. Carbon
accounting is also a highly competitive market with low barriers to entry. Vendors that
achieve excellence in data collection and management and that provide reliable
implementation services will be well-positioned for market leadership.
Materiality
Regulatory Compliance
An increasing number of jurisdictions are mandating GHG emissions reporting. Vendors
are highlighting their capabilities to support speciﬁc regulatory requirements such as
portions of the environmental component of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive (CSRD), the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requirements,
proposed climate ﬁnancial disclosures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and California reporting regulation SB 253.3
Assurance
Many regulators will require limited third-party assurance for GHG emissions report
submissions in order to ensure their integrity. Carbon accounting software can implement
standard procedures around data collection and management including capabilities that:
These data management capabilities can help reduce administrative costs including
internal overhead and external auditing fees.Availability: Data collection, integration and modeling requirements are becoming
more challenging, especially due to the growing urgency to measure Scope 3
emissions.■
Accessibility: Solutions will become more intuitive for nonexperts and the trend
toward cloud solutions, including low-cost self-service solutions, will drive mass
adoption and use.■
Streamline and support assurance, such as the ability to collect and input data and
track all adjustments and methods used to calculate and measure emissions data■
Document and preserve any third-party datasets used, such as emissions factors ■
Enable the ability to trace data back to source systems, and track any edits and
revisions to source data■

Actionability
Emissions Reduction Targets
Demand for capabilities to plan and execute decarbonization initiatives will increase
dramatically in the years ahead. The number of organizations with net zero targets is
rising rapidly. According to Net Zero Tracker, 929 companies from the Forbes Global 2000
list have set net zero targets by 2023 year end; up from 417 in December 2020 and 702 in
June 2022.4
However, a far-off target is not sufﬁcient for stakeholders who are demanding interim
milestones to demonstrate progress. The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in
particular, requires interim milestones and annual reporting of progress. SBTi reports that
it validated as many company targets in 2022 (1,097) as it had in the previous seven
years (1,082 from 2015 through 2021). Effective carbon accounting is critical to SBTi
participants.
A recent Gartner survey of business leaders underscores this accelerating trend, with 78%
of respondents conﬁrming that GHG emission monitoring and mitigation initiatives are
already underway or planned for implementation within the next 24 months (see Figure
3).5

Scope 3 Emissions
Many enterprises are grappling with the complexities of data collection to compute the
various categories of Scope 3 emissions, especially for suppliers of purchased goods and
services. While there is a gradual emergence of primary source data, Gartner anticipates
persistent challenges in this regard from 2024 through 2028. As a result, executives will
need to adopt a multifaceted approach to data collection. This approach includes
leveraging product carbon footprint data sheets, such as those provided by leading IT
equipment vendors (like Lenovo and Dell Technologies for IT equipment) and cloud
computing (such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure). Additionally, ad hoc
supplier surveys will play a crucial role in gathering necessary data.
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 10 of 21
Looking ahead, Gartner expects carbon data will become a standardized element
associated with procurement. We also expect enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors
to extend their core systems to capture and manage carbon-related information. This
expansion will facilitate API-based data collection from ERP systems and other related
sources, including travel and expense (T&E) systems.
Product Sustainability
A specialized niche of Scope 3 vendors is forming to meet the challenges executive
leaders face in organizations that make and/or sell physical products. These executives
need cross-functional teams to prepare the data foundations for product carbon
footprints (PCF) that report the CO2 content of speciﬁc product SKUs in the form of
product carbon labels and product life cycle datasheets. Executives seeking product
differentiation through ecodesign also need to foster cross-functional collaboration and
transform product management processes.
A key regulatory driver is the European Commission’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products
Regulation (ESPR), in which the Digital Product Passport (DPP) initiative is discussed.6
DPPs look to make product sustainability and circularity data, such as PCFs, packaging
and waste available to buyers.7 Calculating accurate PCFs requires carbon data
exchange across value chains. However, this data is not widely available in many
industries. In the near term, executives will need their teams to build product carbon
footprint estimates using life cycle assessment (LCA) datasets, and LCA modeling tools.
One example is Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm (PAIA) now maintained by MIT’s
Material Systems Laboratory, which is being used by some IT hardware vendors to
estimate product carbon footprints.8,9
Accessibility
Several vendors have begun providing self-service solutions at a low price point, including
“freemium” versions of their products. This, coupled with a predominance of cloud-based
offerings, is lowering barriers to entry, bringing basic carbon accounting to the masses.
However, carbon accounting is an emerging discipline and low-end or freemium offerings
may lack the capabilities necessary to evolve reporting and management as more
accurate and reliable data becomes available.
AI for Carbon Management
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 11 of 21
AI shows promise for a number of carbon accounting capabilities including sifting and
categorizing relevant organization data, managing evolving regulations, performing
complex carbon calculations, developing carbon reduction plans and designing lower-
carbon products. Several AI-focused vendors have entered the market seeking to provide
these types of advanced capabilities. Many established vendors are also actively
incorporating AI capabilities into their carbon accounting products. Adoption of AI for
carbon accounting is in its infancy and many implementations are pilots where
capabilities, costs and beneﬁts are yet to be determined.
Buyers should seek clarity on AI functionality from vendors in order to mitigate cost risk.
Seek conﬁrmation if AI will be used for qualitative or narrative functions (such as
managing regulations, the creation of carbon reduction plans, or designing lower carbon
products). Also seek conﬁrmation if AI will be used for quantitative and core solution
workﬂow processes (such as performing complex carbon calculations and emissions
factor matching). Where AI functionality (current or proposed) is used for quantitative and
core solution workﬂow, clarity on pricing structure (tiered, tokenized, or tiered with token
limits) is essential. This clarity is essential so that buyers understand the risk of additional
AI price increases and the likely order of magnitude. Token (a measure of Generative AI
data, which is often a word, part of a word or phrase) thresholds should be included in
contracts, as well as non-AI options to accomplish the same functionality, should AI
pricing become prohibitive.
The carbon accounting and management market is driven by organizations that need to
establish and advance the complex discipline of carbon accounting in situations where
both readily available data and relevant technical expertise are scarce. The market is
emerging with many new entrants or new products launched by established vendors. As
environmental ambition and stakeholder pressures grow, executives in organizations with
established carbon accounting processes are recognizing that they can beneﬁt from
focused carbon accounting and management software. This is especially true in
organizations using an inefﬁcient spreadsheet-based approach, or attempting to meet
carbon accounting requirements with ESG or environmental, health and safety (EHS)
software solutions with limited capabilities. Some are also replacing processes and
workﬂows that were originally designed by sustainability consultants with dedicated
software solutions.
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 12 of 21
Within this landscape, a small number of organizations in carbon-intensive industries
have long-standing legacy deployments of carbon accounting software for measuring
their direct emissions (Scope 1 and 2). Some use internally developed software, while
others have expanded their existing EHS or energy management systems to deliver these
capabilities. These tools are often operationally focused and do not necessarily support
more strategic use cases that well. Tools that have Scope 3 capabilities that are too basic
or entirely lacking are another major shortcoming meaning that those with legacy carbon
accounting software will likely beneﬁt from reevaluating their tooling options.
Industry Differences
Although the GHG Protocol for categorizing and calculating emissions is a constant, there
are signiﬁcant differences in the challenges that various industries face. Executives
should evaluate the relative strengths of different solutions for the industry cluster(s) of
their enterprise:
Organizations with energy-intensive operations produce high amounts of direct
GHG emissions through the combustion of fossil fuels in different forms. The main
focus of near-term decarbonization measures is generally on Scope 1 and 2, though
they may often have extensive Scope 3 emissions to deal with, too. Executives in
these industries should prioritize IT/operations technology (OT) integration and the
ability to integrate direct emissions data captured by sensors and meters.■
Organizations with complex supply chains have a relatively high share of their GHG
emissions attributed to Scope 3 emissions, especially purchased goods and raw
materials. Executives in complex supply chains need to prioritize Scope 3
capabilities, especially for upstream purchases of ﬁnished goods for resale, raw
materials, components and logistics, as well as downstream considerations such as
packaging and shipping.■
Organizations with signiﬁcant financed emissions that are impacted by carbon and
the climate are under pressure from central banks and regulators to measure the
environmental impact of their loans, investments and other ﬁnancial activities. In the
insurance sector, the concept is known as insured emissions. Executives in this
industry cluster should prioritize solutions capable of collecting and managing
carbon accounting data from entities they ﬁnance, including the ability to calculate
ﬁnanced emissions based on ownership structures and shares.■

The diagram below provides more details on speciﬁc verticals that fall under each of the
above emission drivers (see Figure 4).
Figure 4: Industry Clusters for Carbon Accounting and Management SoftwareOrganizations relying on digital business for either their core activity itself or the core
activity’s planning and administration are seeing IT playing an oversized role as a
source of GHG emissions. Executives in these organizations need to prioritize
capabilities for tracking and managing the product carbon footprint of IT devices.
Examples include circularity services for end-of-life treatment of IT assets and the
ability to calculate emissions from cloud computing.■

Competitive Dynamics
Corporate interest in carbon accounting and management software is high and barriers to
entry into the market are low. The accounting layer is based on the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol — an open, freely available methodological standard. A small team of software
developers can quickly create a compelling demonstration using generally available data
and analytics tools, and deliver a minimum viable product in a matter of months.
However, the long-term value of carbon accounting lies in its underlying data collection
and management capabilities and other key capabilities (see Note 2). Beyond the
rudimentary support of the GHG protocol in the form of basic data collection and
visualizations, the market offers a lot of room for technical innovation and product
differentiation. Vendors can enhance the common capabilities outlined in the market
description section to achieve differentiation.
One area of differentiation is emissions factors that are used to convert activities into
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) units. Emissions factors can vary considerably in
granularity and this can impact both the accuracy of calculations as well as the ability of
an organization to take credit for emissions reduction activities like switching from a
fossil fuel to a biofuel. For example, a vendor has the option to offer a basic emission
factor library obtained from public sources like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Alternatively, they can
differentiate themselves by licensing a commercial emission factor library from a third-
party data provider, or they can opt to maintain their own exclusive dataset. Similarly,
there can be signiﬁcant differences in capabilities for automating data collection. For
instance, some vendors are investing in AI-based capabilities for data discovery.
In the long term, the competitive landscape in carbon accounting and management has
several possible evolutionary paths:
Market consolidation — Consolidation is achieved through the acquisition of carbon
accounting vendors by adjacent organizations or point solution markets, such as
ESG software, governance risk and compliance (GRC) or EHS markets. Note that
carbon accounting and management vendors with horizontal cross-industry
capabilities are more attractive targets than verticalized industry-speciﬁc solutions.■
Industry specialization — The demand for solutions that enable PCF and LCA may
drive the emergence of carbon accounting specialists that have a depth of
capabilities in speciﬁc industry value chains.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 15 of 21
Gartner expects carbon accounting and management to be a priority market for
organizations with complex carbon footprints over at least the next three years. See 4
Scenarios to Guide Your ESG and Sustainability Software Choices for further analysis.
Representative Vendors
The vendors listed in this Market Guide do not imply an exhaustive list. This section is
intended to provide more understanding of the market and its offerings.
Vendor Selection
For inclusion in this Market Guide, the software mentioned represents carbon accounting
products that we see on organization shortlists or longlists (see Table 1). These solutions
cover a range of common capabilities outlined in Figure 2 and should be capable of
generating data used in voluntary ESG reports, regulatory disclosures and ﬁnancial
statements. Vendors with broad cross-industry capabilities are prioritized over industry-
speciﬁc solutions.Add-on capabilities — Providers of speciﬁc industry solutions, such as OT systems,
may provide solutions, such as vendors of industrial equipment and technology,
either as stand-alone providers or channel partners for specialized solutions.■

Market Recommendations
In addition to the capabilities identiﬁed in this research, executive leaders need to take a
number of factors into account as they work with sustainability leaders to develop carbon
accounting requirements and evaluate vendors. Executives should also consider:
Sustainability ambition — Is the carbon accounting objective solely reporting for
regulatory compliance? Or, are there targets in place for carbon reduction such as a
net zero pledge or interim targets? Carbon reduction planning and modeling
capabilities become important if it’s the latter. Keep in mind that ambitions may
evolve over time. Create a strategic roadmap for GHG data and analytics to future-
proof selections (see 2023 Strategic Roadmap for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data
and Analytics), and keep in mind that several niche solutions may be necessary.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00799496 Page 17 of 21
Carbon use cases — Identify and scope as many relevant use cases as possible,
then analyze your use cases to identify key users, capabilities, data sources and
application integrations. For instance, the product carbon footprint is important for
manufacturing. ERP is a key data source and integration with product life cycle
management (PLM) and manufacturing execution systems (MES) is desirable.
Conversely, carbon footprints from travel, real estate and IT equipment and services
are key for professional services ﬁrms.■
Efficiency improvements — An effective carbon accounting solution should reduce
administrative overhead associated with collecting and managing data. Seek APIs
for data collection, management and sharing, automated error checking and data
validation capabilities. Seek workﬂow solutions to manage manual data entry.■
External assurance — Work with internal audit leaders to evaluate capabilities for
the right level of assurance, whether that’s limited assurance or more rigorous
reasonable assurance. See How to Build Conﬁdence in ESG Disclosures With the
Right Level of External Assurance for details. Fully understand the data audit
capabilities and limitations of carbon accounting and management solutions,
including data progeny, transformation, emissions factor matching correctness and
consistency over multiple reporting periods.■
Data model flexibility — Evaluate vendor capabilities to conﬁgure their solution to
align with your organizational structure and how you manage and report data
internally (also known as organization taxonomy). Also evaluate acquisition and
divestiture modeling capabilities if your organization takes such corporate actions.
This includes the ability to rebaseline and recalculate emissions, and conducting a
what/if analysis to evaluate the impacts of different actions on emissions
performance.■
Total solution cost — Evaluate vendor capabilities and proposal scope in terms of
implementing a fully functional solution and providing ongoing support. Also
analyze vendor pricing models to evaluate the risk of cost escalation and/or “show
stopper pricing” such as pricing based on number of data collection sites, number of
users and the deﬁnition of what a user is. Be wary of open-ended service clauses
that could lead to unanticipated and/or difﬁcult-to-manage consulting services.
Favor vendors that bundle in employee education and ongoing solution support as
part of their SaaS agreement.■

This Market Guide provides Gartner’s initial coverage of the market and focuses on the
market deﬁnition, rationale for the market and market dynamics.
Note 2: Common Capabilities of Carbon Accounting and
Management Software
Common capabilities of carbon accounting and management software include:
Adherence to the GHG Protocol: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol was established to
address the need for an international standard corporations could use to account for,
report and track progress toward climate goals. It is currently the most widely used
GHG accounting standard for companies.■
Data collection: Collecting, measuring and calculating Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions is
a key functionality for carbon accounting and management tools. Data collection
and input capabilities range from manual to automated.■
Emission factor libraries: Emission factors are representative values that attempt to
relate the quantity of a pollutant released into the atmosphere with an activity
associated with the release of that pollutant. Carbon accounting and management
tools should have libraries where emission factors are stored. Emission factor
sources should be available and customization of these factors and their associated
calculations is desirable.■
Configurable data models: The solution should house a collection of structured,
unstructured and semistructured data across carbon sources. It should be
conﬁgurable and aligned to corporate taxonomy such as divisions, subsidiaries,
regions, and facilities and align with commonly accepted standards such as the
GHG protocol.■
Data visualization: Data visualization should be offered to track and communicate
performance across the organization. Opportunities for visualization may include
the ability to view data by location, business unit or supplier. Visualization should
also allow users to drill down into detailed data, geospatial overlays and comparison
charts.■

Ignition Guide to Building a Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Roadmap
Market Guide for ESG Management and Reporting SoftwareAudit support and data governance: Solutions should establish procedures around
data collection and permissions based on data type while creating a complete audit
trail. Data governance is a key feature that allows users to assign data owners, who
are responsible for collecting and entering the relevant data for their assigned area.
These two capabilities improve data quality, consistency and integrity.■
Carbon calculation methodologies: Solutions should enable organizations to
calculate their total carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3. This capability
should provide users with the ability to calculate their Scope 3 emissions by
adhering to one of the four main measurement methodologies: spend-based,
activity-based, supplier-speciﬁc or hybrid.■
Support for emission reduction strategies: Solutions should be able to support
organization emission reduction strategies by assisting in setting targets and
metrics and providing an opportunity to track and communicate progress. Some
vendors may provide these services separately from their solution via internal
consultants or through external partnerships.■

Insights for Investors
Sustainability efforts and managing the ESG impact have been
unilaterally focused on mitigating internal risk and ensuring
compliance. Product leaders must evolve by embracing double
materiality and holistic leverage of emerging technologies to meet
sustainability objectives.
Overview
Opportunities
Recommendations
Product leaders responsible for incorporating sustainability in products and services must
take these steps:Compliance and risk approaches are ineffective at meeting ambitious sustainability
goals. Organizations placing sustainability at the core of their business with
optimization or even transformational goals will achieve positive business outcomes
because of cost savings and market differentiation.■
Generative AI (GenAI) has brought about new possibilities as it enables new
experiences, material efﬁciencies and brand new use cases. This and other emerging
technologies are often only evaluated in terms of associated beneﬁts — leaving
undesirable trade-offs as a blindspot in the context of sustainability.■
Assess your organization’s double materiality impact by highlighting the
opportunities as well as the (future) ﬁnancial risks in products and services should
environmental issues not be addressed in the medium to long term.■

Strategic Planning Assumptions
By 2028, GenAI will be used by 25% of global companies to optimize emission reduction
pathways to net zero up from less than 5% today.
By 2028, GenAI will both speed up climate change modeling and deliver personalized
climate risk-aware dynamic insurance pricing for business and citizens.
What You Need to Know
This research takes a focused look into the maturation of sustainable business, which is
one of the 10 highlighted trends in 2024 Tech Provider Top Trends.
Technology providers face the double challenge of prioritizing sustainable product design
and enabling their clients to achieve sustainability goals. A sustainability strategy treated
as a siloed or compliance-based approach will generate little outcomes. Instead, taking
the full perspective of sustainability into account is vital to not only improve one’s
sustainability performance but also drive business growth. Among the surveyed business
leaders, 83% see their sustainability programs as a means to create value and to recover
from disruption impacts, instead of as a cost of doing business.1 These results point to
an encouraging shift in the mindset of business leaders; however, most organizations still
follow the compliance risk-based approach.
From 2023 onward, there have been several new dynamics at play, one of the primaries
being GenAI technologies’ impact on product leaders’ ability to execute on sustainability
outcomes with their product and service offerings. Using the analogy of life stages,
sustainable business appears to have entered its “teenage years” marked by great
ambitions, high uncertainty, being pulled in many directions and experiencing setbacks.Capture the value of GenAI technologies by addressing the use cases where the
beneﬁts clearly outweigh the environmental impacts, for example, using GenAI-
based applications for increased resource efﬁciency for your products (thereby
reducing waste).■

The tech industry has seen some success at reducing its carbon intensity but the
progress to reduce the absolute emissions in high-growth markets has turned out to be
difficult to achieve. Stagnation is the result of treating sustainability as a compliance risk-
based approach. Technology providers should view sustainability as an element of their
overall business strategy. Product leaders need aligned incentives and a clear path to
achieve their own product sustainability goals. Large tech companies following the global
trend see the market bifurcating into two groups:
The latter group is exposing itself to higher risks down the road as regulations are
increasing in complexity and number. It is also barely helping overall progress in
sustainability performance and does little to drive bigger, transformative changes that are
urgently needed, such as enabling the shift to renewable energy and reducing absolute
emissions.
Especially large tech innovators need to invest capital into renewable energy creation to
increase global supply of the same. For example, large tech providers communicating
their strong commitment to renewable energy usage is not moving the needle. Projections
show that for a successful global energy transition, investment of $290 billion for
renewable enerygy’s end uses and district heat is needed annually until 2030 yet we are
falling well short of this target.2
At the core of sustainability conundrum lies the collision of present-day observations, and
long-term impacts and beneﬁts. Fundamentally, humans and businesses skew toward
present bias, insufﬁciently weighing the present-day investments that need to be done for
a sustainable future.Tech providers that have made progress against their net zero goals by setting
strategic ambitions for sustainability including compliance, optimization and
transformation (see Balance the Environmental Perils and Promises of Generative
AI).■
Tech providers failing to achieve their interim greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
targets and/or have retracted sustainability goals.2 This is often linked to taking a
sole compliance risk-balancing approach rather than approaches taken by
companies in the ﬁrst group.■

Present bias, which inﬂuences much of our actions, places subconscious prioritization on
events that are happening now rather than those that will/may happen in the (far) future.
This bias hinders organizations’ (and individuals’) motivation to follow through with
actions that don’t seem urgent today but are even more pressing for a sustainable future.
Figure 1 depicts the main areas of consideration and impact for product leaders when
designing for sustainability. Product leaders’ sustainable business conduct impacts their
own organization and has direct implications for their clients’ sustainability posture.

Sustainable business is a strategy that incorporates environmental, social and
governmental (ESG) factors into decision making (see Figure 2). It is a holistic approach
where sustainability thinking drives day-to-day business decisions throughout an
organization. In an increasingly technology-driven world, sustainable business is
underpinned by sustainable technology — a framework of solutions that enable ESG
outcomes. The instrumental role that technology plays in enabling sustainable business
is that product leaders at technology and service providers (TSPs) are both shaping and
being shaped by the new strategy.

In the 2022 Gartner Sustainability Opportunities, Risks and Technologies Survey, 42% of
executive leaders indicated that their organization drives innovation and differentiation,
and creates strategic value from sustainability initiatives. While these are encouraging
results, there are still a large number of organizations pursuing sustainability goals with
the main goal to “check the compliance box.” The rapid adoption of GenAI is adding a
new dimension to the discussion in two ways — 1) the compute intensity of GenAI models
raises concerns about the environmental impact in terms of energy requirements and
hence GHG emission impact, and 2) organizations are starting to explore ways to use
GenAI to achieve positive sustainability outcomes.
Current Sustainability Risks and Challenges
Gartner has identiﬁed three levels of strategic ambitions that organizations can engage in
How to Set Strategic Ambition for Sustainability. A compliance-based sustainability
approach is a strategic ambition with the lowest short-term investment, focusing primarily
on mitigating direct risk from regulators. However, this approach bears several risks in the
midterm to long term due to several factors:
1. Sustainability requirements are constantly changing and pressure from various
stakeholders is increasing. Adapting reactively to these changes can create more
costs for an organization or product leaders in the long term as transformational
changes may require more resources to scale quickly as opposed to taking action at
an earlier point in time. Product leaders may ﬁnd themselves in a situation where
they will have to make substantial changes to products and services in order to stay
competitive.
2. Access to capital is increasingly tied to corporate sustainability performance.3
Product leaders may not be involved in corporate ﬁnance and governance decisions
but still need to see the bigger picture and how their actions will either contribute to
or counter their company’s sustainable business strategy. They need to build upon
long-term sustainability goals for their products rather than short-term compliance-
based thinking.
3. Greenwashing practices have grown globally exhibiting a wide spectrum of
incidents. These incidents range from unsubstantiated sustainability claims to
intransparency and blatantly false claims. The result is greater scrutiny of
companies and their practices.Example: After legal investigations by the SEC, the
subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, DWS had to pay $19 million for greenwashing
practices. According to the SEC, DWS Group’s claims of ESG factors driving their
investment decisions for their ﬁnancial products were exaggerated.

Other companies claim to be carbon neutral but when drilling down to the details, the
actual impact is rather mediocre or even goes in the wrong direction.
The above highlights the underlying complexity and one of the reasons for the slow
progress in the industry. It also shows that a bare compliance-based approach can leave
organizations exposed without considering the opportunities that sustainable business
can bring and that can be exploited.
GenAI and Sustainability Opportunities
GenAI-based technologies provide new opportunities for product leaders as they deliver
numerous new experiences and use cases for products and service offerings. At the same
time, product leaders need to be aware of and act on the technology’s potential undesired
sustainability consequences.
GenAI drives business value primarily from operational efﬁciency gains. As product
leaders are in the midst of adopting GenAI in their products and services, they need to
evaluate the impact of those productivity gains on sustainability (see Emerging Tech: Top
Emerging GenAI Use Cases in AI Services and 9 Environmental Implications of Generative
AI). Some example use cases of GenAI for sustainability include:Netﬂix stated that their service was carbon neutral in 2021, despite its carbon
footprint increasing by 50% year over year reaching 1.5 million metric tons. Carbon
neutrality was achieved by purchasing 1.5 million carbon credits in the same year.
There are various issues with this approach, including the following:■
The effective public communication of carbon neutrality distracts from the fact
that an organization is still producing a large amount of emissions.■
The reduction of absolute emissions becomes secondary, which pushes the
global climate goal by 2050 to be more and more unrealistic and
unattainable.4■
The industry is currently experiencing a carbon certiﬁcate crisis. Recent
research and studies have revealed that over 90% of CO2 certiﬁcates issued by
the market leader Verra (based on projects in the rainforests) may not represent
any emission reductions.5■

Despite all the excitement around GenAI technology, the industry has to deal with
challenges that are unlikely to be resolved in the short term and that are impacting all
three areas of ESG:
1. Environment: The environmental impact of compute-intensive GenAI technologies —
especially large language models (LLMs) require large compute power during
training and execution because they are highly scalable. Higher energy consumption
and resource-intensive cooling are potential negative consequences. Product leaders
need to consider that the negative impacts of GenAI should not be shifted to third
parties, such as cloud providers. If cloud services are used, product leaders must
choose responsible partners to ensure GenAI beneﬁts outweigh negative
sustainability impacts (see How Product Managers Should Lead Using
Environmental Sustainability by Design).
2. Social/people: GenAI models can produce biased or even harmful content that
discriminates against or violates company guidelines going against an
organization’s values. In most cases, training data is the root cause of these issues
as most of the largest available foundation models on the market have been trained
with publicly available web data. Most internet data overrepresents certain
demographics and English content causing signiﬁcant bias.
3. Governance: Data processing, model reliability and accuracy need to be managed to
reduce or eliminate AI hallucinations to create trust. Explainability and responsible AI
needs to be managed via a framework that product leaders and everyone else need
to follow.
Product leaders need to consider the impact of their GenAI-enabled products on:New insights generation for biodiversity monitoring ■
Resource efﬁciency through waste reduction and increased resource visibility ■
Improve carbon certiﬁcate quality by harmonizing heterogenous data and data
provenance provisioning■
The sustainability of products and services ■
The overall organization ■
Adopers (client organizations) ■

Product leaders need to be selective when adopting GenAI and review carefully where
negative impact may outweigh the beneﬁts of using GenAI. To mitigate the environmental
risks in particular, product leaders can evaluate a few options. For example, avoiding
using the most powerful LLM for a GenAI application that does only simple text
summarization. LLM providers are launching domain-speciﬁc models and smaller
versions almost on a weekly basis, so more suitable options are becoming available.
Other trends we are currently seeing emerging to cap power consumption/usage are via
tiered pricing and availability during peak times. OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Plus, which
is a monthly pricing option providing full access to the chatbot during peak times.
Implications:
Double Materiality to Induce Progress
Double materiality is an emerging concept that emphasizes an organization’s
sustainability posture and its impact on ﬁnancial performance. This principle reshapes
sustainability reporting practices as it directs organizations toward adopting a two-
pronged approach:
Double materiality has been incorporated by multiple global directives and
standardization bodies, including Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and
the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). Since it is a central
component and requirement in the European CSRD, we expect accelerated adoption
among TSPs over the next two to three years on a global scale. For example, Telefónica
started applying the concept in 2021 by assessing in detail both climate change risks and
opportunities, hence considering the cost for renewable energy transition and reputational
risks as well as cost reductions derived from resource efﬁciencies.
This new approach impacts product leaders on several levels. It requires a risk- and
opportunity-based assessment of their product and service portfolio that combines both
value creation and environmental thinking. There are a number of steps and
considerations for product leaders:The inside-out perspective examines an organization’s ESG impact, considering a
company’s impact of business activities under environmental, social and
governance aspects.■
The outside-in perspective (ﬁnancial materiality) considers risks and opportunities of
sustainability issues on the organization’s ﬁnancial performance and whether the
company’s business model is future-proof.■

GenAI for Sustainability: A Balancing Act
GenAI has a great impact on business, including content discovery, creation, authenticity
and regulations; automation of human work; and the customer and employee experience.
While GenAI applied to sustainability use cases is still an emerging area today, we expect
signiﬁcant growth over the next three years. Some of the largest IT service providers are
currently expanding their AI service offerings with GenAI capabilities driving sustainability
outcomes.
Implications of GenAI for Product Leaders
The implications of product leaders integrating GenAI into their product and service
offerings are shown in Table 1.Review existing product and service portfolios to identify opportunities and emerging
risks in the context of the overall company’s materiality issues. As organizations are
likely to move to a double materiality approach, product leaders will have to do their
part to ensure their offerings help improve the sustainability posture of the
organization and improve its ﬁnancial situation. For example, an electronic device
manufacturer may identify cost-saving opportunities by reducing packaging, saving
material and transportation costs.■
Apply a sustainability-by-design approach that considers ESG impacts when
designing new products and services, and the risks and opportunities that this future
product or service will be exposed to, based on the deﬁned ESG criteria. For example,
HMD Global, the producer of Nokia-branded phones, has launched a new product
design in 2023 that allows for better repairability.■

Operations
One of the deﬁning attributes of this top trend is its multifaceted impact on different parts
of a TSP’s business operations. That is also the case for sustainable business, whose
impact across the analyzed six domains is summarized in Table 2. We expect the largest
impact to be on products and services and the ecosystem that TSPs operate in, the latter
because essentially sustainability goals can only be achieved via collaboration and
partnerships.

opportunities as well as the (future) ﬁnancial risks that your existing product is
exposed to should environmental issues not be addressed.■
Capture the value of GenAI technologies by addressing the use cases where the
beneﬁts clearly outweigh the environmental impact for example using GenAI-based
applications for increased resource efﬁciency for your products (thereby reducing
waste).■
Incorporate GenAI models in your products that are suitable for the task by selecting
the most efﬁcient model size. This lowers energy requirements as well as cost.■

Business Operations Scale of Impact Scope of Impact
Products and Services Very High Tech products and services are a critical enabler in
sustainability — and sometimes a liability. Product
leaders must recognize the opportunities and
challenges as a new parameter for product
planning and development. This is for both, its own
company’s sustainability posture and empowering
customers to reduce their environmental footprint.
Customers and Buyers High Sustainability is a growing consideration for
organizations making adoption and buying
decisions on technology. Product leaders must
understand how it influences buyer behavior,
which may have significant variation.
Operations and Processes Medium TSPs are under pressure to improve their own
sustainability. Product leaders must do their part
and assess how their product responsibility
influences the company’s operations and ESG
impact.
Competitive Landscape High Sustainability reshuffles competitive dynamics by
changing business and compliance demands.
Product leaders must monitor the regional and
vertical differences that continue to develop.

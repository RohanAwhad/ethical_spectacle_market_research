Initiatives:Supply Chain Leadership
Supply chains must measure sustainability outcomes to track
impact, but such metrics provide little clarity for staff on how their
activities impact goals. CSCOs can use this research to align a set
of metrics to guide action, communicate value and unlock
progress toward sustainability goals.
Overview
Key Findings
Recommendations
CSCOs responsible for achieving progress toward sustainability goals should:Chief supply chain ofﬁcers (CSCOs) struggle to determine sustainability metrics that
both drive action and measure impact. Outcome-focused metrics, such as
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are difﬁcult for leaders to translate into action,
while incremental metrics often result in a myopic focus.■
Increased sustainability reporting requirements — driven by regulators, investors and
customers — risk diverting resources from action to measurement.■
Determine the supply chain input activities that contribute to the organization’s
sustainability outcome goals by using Gartner’s Input to Outcome Sustainability
Metrics Framework.■
Communicate the value and impact of sustainability initiatives to diverse
stakeholders by measuring and reporting internal and external outcomes.■

Introduction
For most organizations, supply chain is the key driver of environmental impact and also
the most critical stakeholder to secure the achievement of ambitious sustainability goals.
However, only 43% of supply chain leaders report that metrics and data enable decision
making in alignment with organizational purpose today.1 Increased reporting
requirements — such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) —
stand to enhance reporting rigor, but threaten to further divert scarce resources from
sustainability action to measurement.
How can supply chains deliver critical sustainability goals when their metrics are not
clearly informing decision making? More bluntly, how can leaders throughout the
organization reduce their impact when they don’t know how?
While it is critical to track environmental outcomes to ensure progress toward
sustainability goals, it is equally important to connect those external outcomes to internal
actions. This ensures the sustainability program resonates with leaders across the supply
chain organization. Moreover, to maintain momentum, CSCOs must track the business
beneﬁts of their sustainability activities.
Organizations can use Gartner’s Input to Outcome Sustainability Metrics Framework to set
the right foundation for their program and enable long-term outcomes (see Figure 1).

Analysis
Link Input Activities to Output Metrics
CSCOs and other supply chain leaders are juggling a list of indicators to measure
progress toward key sustainability goals, targets and KPIs required for external reporting.
As disclosure legislation such as the EU’s CSRD proliferate, these KPI lists will become
longer. Rein in such unwieldy lists of sustainability metrics by determining how the
metrics relate to one another to create metrics “stories.” For example, circular economy
strategies are not an end but a means to deliver improved environmental impact.
Connecting these dots will enable them to effectively assess trade-offs and organize
metrics into a clear impact story.
CSCOs can tell better impact stories by using Gartner’s Input to Outcome Sustainability
Metrics Framework to demonstrate how program inputs, or activities, have led to short-
term outputs and long-term outcomes.
Input Metrics
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00801787 Page 4 of 8
Input activities are supply chain activities that ultimately lead to the achievement of goals
set by the enterprise. Input activities (see examples in Table 1) build a strong foundation
to support progress toward external goals, and measuring them can help you make data-
driven decisions. These metrics assess program inputs that CSCOs can control, such as
supply chain activities, staff effort or alignment with sustainability expectations. This
could include the number of sustainability training sessions delivered to internal or
external stakeholders, and the number of sites offering a product take-back program.
Input activities build a strong foundation to create a ripple effect and reach outcome-
based results. Measuring input activities can also help leaders make data-driven decisions
on program resourcing.
For example, Intel has set ambitious targets for water stewardship in its semiconductor
supply chain, with a net positive water commitment that seeks to conserve 60 billion
gallons of water in Intel’s operations by 2030.2 To deliver this outcome, Intel has built
comprehensive water models for its manufacturing sites to enable real-time visibility into
water balances and impact analysis of water management strategies. The number of
manufacturing sites that have developed and deployed this tool serves as an input metric,
enabling an output of enhanced water management.
Output Metrics
Output metrics are a measure of the intermediate impacts that ﬂow from program inputs.
It can be tempting to measure and report these intermediate impacts as outcomes of the
organization’s sustainability work. Yet, while program outputs contribute to the ultimate
program outcomes, outputs alone are insufﬁcient. For example, an organization deploying
a circular economy effort might report the volume of returned materials collected. This is
a good start, but the returned materials are not delivering stakeholder value until they
contribute to an internal or external need. The returned materials might deliver waste
diversion from landﬁll, an external outcome. Better yet, they might be recaptured as supply
and reduce the volume of new materials needed. This would contribute to material
efﬁciency, an internal outcome, and GHG emissions reduction, an external outcome.
Schneider Electric aims to increase the use of green materials in its products to 50% by
2025. This is a key output metric, which contributes to Schneider Electric’s outcome goal
to reduce upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions.3
Measure Program Value and Impact Using Outcome Metrics
Outcome
Outcome-based metrics result from consistent investment in inputs and communicate
impact to internal and external stakeholders:

Danone
In rolling out a cross-functional initiative to reduce food waste across the organization,
Danone crafted a comprehensive toolkit outlining best practices for food waste
reduction across the organization (see Video: How Danone Equips the Organization to
Achieve Sustainability Goals). Implementation across the organization was measured
to ensure the toolkit’s use and effectiveness. To track the program’s impact, Danone
leveraged internal and external outcome metrics. The internal metrics assessed the
productivity of cost of goods sold (COGS) to communicate how the food waste
initiative contributed to cost efﬁciency and created ﬁnancial value for the organization.
The program’s external outcome metrics included GHG emissions reduction, and the
food waste initiative was part of a broader effort to achieve progress toward Danone’s
ambitious emissions reduction target.
CSCOs should aim to have at least one set of input-output outcome metrics for each
material issue. Note that the relationship between these metrics is not always 1:1. There
are often many inputs required to deliver an outcome.
Table 1 provides examples of input-output and outcome metrics that CSCOs can track to
better illustrate program value.Internal outcome metrics are critical to building momentum and communicating the
business value of sustainability activities. These metrics capture business impact,
including number of innovations, cost savings, customer retention and revenue
growth.■
External outcome metrics address the ultimate goal of the sustainability program
for stakeholders, including GHG emissions reduction, reduced water consumption
and enhanced worker well-being. Outcome metrics selection will vary based on
stakeholder sentiment, industry and material areas of focus.■

Taking It Forward
Without communicating a broad set of metrics, sustainability risks losing investments
needed for sustained growth and long-term value. CSCOs should consider the following
keys to success when implementing the Input to Outcome Framework:
Determine and prioritize the key external sustainability outcomes to which the supply
chain organization will contribute. Use materiality assessment and legislative
reporting requirements to guide this process (see Ignition Guide to Conducting a
Materiality Assessment for Sustainability Executives).■
Translate these external goals into internal actions using input and output metrics. ■
Consistency is key to drive outcomes. Invest in consistent improvement of input and
output metrics.■
Capture the value to the enterprise by tracking and regularly communicating internal
outcome metrics.■

Evidence
1 2022 Gartner Future of Supply Chain Survey. This research draws on analysis of our
2022 Future of Supply Chain Survey ﬁelded from August 2022 through October 2022,
which surveyed 676 supply chain leaders at Gartner client organizations across 13 major
industries and four regions.  Respondents were asked to rate their supply chain’s progress
on current capabilities and expectations and plans for future capabilities. Capabilities and
expected challenges to meeting these were measured across four sections (commercial
innovation, authentic achievement of sustainability, human-centric work design, and real-
time decision execution), as well as the understood timelines for the organizations to
make these shifts.  High-performing organizations and low-performing organizations were
segmented based on the question:  “How would you characterize the overall performance
of your supply chain organization in supporting corporate goals and objectives, over the
past 12 months? ”The question measured a respondent’s perception of their organization’s
overall performance across eight categories: Customer lead time, customer satisfaction,
employee engagement and satisfaction, ESG goals, on time, in full (OTIF) performance,
overall revenue and growth, return on capital investment, and time to market for new
products and services. Performance for each of these categories was self-rated on a ﬁve-
point scale from “Signiﬁcantly below expectations” to “Signiﬁcantly above expectations,”
with “Meeting expectations” as the midpoint for the scale. 
The data followed an approximately normal distribution (i.e., it was not skewed toward
self-rated high performance or low performance), and an analysis of internal consistency
found that the eight categories strongly represented one construct. Therefore, the average
score across the eight items (removing items where a respondent answered, “Don’t
know/not applicable”) was used as a proxy for overall organizational performance.
2 The 2023 Gartner Power of the Profession Supply Chain Awards received entries within
four categories (“customer or patient innovation,” “people breakthrough,” “process or
technology innovation,” and “social impact”). The submissions occurred on an online
platform between September and October of 2022. Each submission was asked to
summarize their innovation, what differentiates it from standard practice, what has
changed due to the innovation, and how it is quantiﬁable.

Analysis
What You Need to Know
The life science industry stands at an inﬂection point driven by emerging technologies
spanning AI, automation and advanced analytics. Driven by the hype from ChatGPT,
GenAI has elevated AI discussions to new levels, drawing great interest from business
leaders across the life science organization. Yet, CIOs must pragmatically harness these
innovations, aligning them to core business objectives, while avoiding hype-driven pitfalls.
This sets the stage for our 2024 predictions, which center on the growing role of AI in life
sciences. Notable shifts that are underway include:
Scaling In Silico Research Approaches: AI and machine learning offer the potential
to accelerate drug discovery and development. Biopharma organizations are heavily
investing in developing their computational research approaches as in silico
research takes center stage. Yet, inadequate performance of AI-derived drugs in the
clinical setting1,2,3 have understandably fostered a sense of skepticism toward these
techniques, underscoring the importance of stringent validation procedures and
ongoing strategy reﬁnement.■
Analytical Rigor and AI Governance: As GenAI and machine learning capabilities
proliferate across R&D, it is undeniable that investments in analytical rigor and AI
governance will inform successful drug development. Capabilities for monitoring,
version tracking and auditing will become essential for operational use cases.
Implementing AI observability tools to ensure regulatory compliance will also be
essential as these techniques move beyond theoretical promise into commercial
products.■
Enhanced Sales Representative Efficiency: In the commercial organization, human-
centered AI will connect patients, providers and partners through conversational
interactions. Virtual assistants with emotional intelligence will help unlock the
potential of sales teams, making every touchpoint smarter, more meaningful and
effective.■
Holistic Stewarding of Assets: Stewarding of assets (data, human, ﬁnancial,
natural) will be the new competitive advantage. It is imperative for biopharma
organizations to embrace comprehensive sustainability endeavors that encompass
greener facilities, circular supply chains and a life-cycle-oriented approach. These
holistic initiatives will not only contribute to environmental well-being but will also
emerge as a distinct competitive advantage in the industry.■

Strategic Planning Assumptions
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2026, investment in experimental and computational
lab integration and translational capabilities will double, due to subpar real-world
performance of AI-generated drugs.
Analysis by: Reuben Harwood
Key Findings:
Market Implications:The rate of AI-generated drugs is accelerating as all major biopharma companies
invest in this area. The market size accounted for $1.5 billion in 2022 and is
estimated to grow at a 30.1% 2023-2032 CAGR.4 The AI-fueled drug pipeline has
been expanding at an annual rate of almost 40%.5■
AI-generated drugs are facing challenges with instances of failures in clinical trials
and achieving therapeutic effectiveness, including:1,2,3■
U.K.-based biotech Exscientia and Bristol Myers Squibb ended a Phase Ib/IIa
trial of its cancer drug EXS21546.6■
Sum it o mo Pharma ended research into a drug for obsessive-compulsive
disorder in partnership with Ex sci en tia because the drug failed to meet study
criteria.7■
BenevolentAI’s lead drug failed to beat a placebo in a Phase IIa atopic
dermatitis study.8■
The progression from preclinical research to clinical trials is a well-known bottleneck,
as laboratory research does not translate well into the clinical setting.■
Candidate pipelines are ballooning as AI systems efﬁciently churn out preclinical
leads. This is overwhelming clinical departments with more investigational new drug
(IND) ﬁlings to evaluate as AI output outpaces their bandwidth.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00803694 Page 6 of 18
Recommendations:To cope with ballooned pipelines, minimum viable trials with faster cycles will be
implemented. But this approach will involve less rigorous designs and is likely to
yield limited insights on the clinical potential of drugs, risking high rates of late-
phase failure due to poorly screened candidates in minimal proof of concept (POC)
studies.■
As AI-designed drugs continue to underperform in the clinical setting, disillusionment
will set in as ROI remains unchanged, despite efﬁciency gains in candidate creation
as the limitations of the technology become better known. Few AI-designed drugs
will be successful by 2026, triggering a thorough review for greater understanding of
where current AI techniques bring value in drug discovery processes to determine
where improved or combined techniques are needed.■
Momentum will shift from faster target and drug identiﬁcation and development to a
focus on a deeper integration of experimental and computational labs and the
development of improved translational capabilities.■
Life science leaders will recognize AI for what it truly is — a highly potent tool that
can facilitate signiﬁcant progress in a ﬁeld that continuously generates vast
amounts of data that historically exceeded human capacity for comprehensive
analysis.■
CIOs in life science organizations should carefully evaluate the AI solutions they
choose to integrate into their R&D processes, emphasizing the importance of
thorough validation and real-world effectiveness. Factor in the potential for marginal
gains over current methods rather than transformative change in development
cycles.■
Increase investment in integrated lab infrastructure and seamless data ﬂows
between domains. Address systemic data quality and quantity issues that impact
the value of your AI-driven drug discovery initiatives. Focus on ﬁndable, accessible,
interoperable, reusable (FAIR) data principles, and enable data sharing between
traditional and computational laboratories.■
Ensure that your chosen vendors are grounded in practical solutions, with a proven
track record of delivering on their promises. This approach will safeguard your
organization from investing in technologies that may be more buzz than substance,
and ensure that your IT solutions meet the real-world needs of your life science
company.■

GenAI capabilities introduce powerful new approaches to drafting, aggregating,
organizing and collating regulatory content during the clinical development life
cycle.■
Life science companies must ensure computer systems meet GxP requirements,
meaning that they must be validated for use and maintained in a state of control.
Currently, GenAI outputs are not easily explainable.■
Automating content development processes to a requisite level of quality and to
comply with existing regulations will require new approaches to ensure GenAI
outputs are observable and not simply a black box delivering the desired outputs
from speciﬁc process inputs.■

“Before ChatGPT, the software we all worked with was
deterministic and always produced the same outputs given the
same inputs, following predefined rules. Probabilistic software
incorporates randomness and statistical likelihood to generate a
range of variables but likely outputs for the same inputs.
Deterministic software is easy to verify by QA or business unit.
GenAI is not.” ⁹
— Pratik Daga, Asana, Generative AI Observability: Issues and
Solutions, British Computing Society
GenAI is broader than traditional computer systems, which typically function by
making operational decisions based on predetermined criteria already anticipated
and comprehensively tested. Many life science companies are investigating this
technology for content and insight generation, with the promise of process
optimization driving adoption:■
Sanoﬁ announced back in Spring 2023 that it was using GenAI to drive new patient
insights and support the development of regulatory content.10■
Syneos Health partnered with Microsoft in Spring 2023 to leverage AI to speed
clinical research.11■
AbbVie has a number of AI projects, both in partnership with external vendors and
internally using its own open-source GPT capabilities.12■
Inscrutable GenAI offerings will be challenged because black box computer systems
that lack visibility into the machine decisions made to produce an output cannot
currently be validated for use in life sciences. All actions from these systems must
be transparent for regulatory review. Even human operators are required to be trained
and to stay within the boundaries of an SOP, and systems must be trained to do the
same. Quality output requires quality controls.13■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00803694 Page 9 of 18
Recommendations:
Related Research:To leverage GenAI for operational use cases, life science organizations require
explainable and observable AI outputs to accompany certain decisions made by the
algorithm, no matter the complexity or the impacts on performance. This will
inevitably provide transparency around these operations. Further, there is an urgent
need for process controls that limit machine output from these solutions, as well as
capabilities that can be maintained with control over any changes.■
Work with industry colleagues and regulators as steps are taken to establish
guidelines around AI explainability and observability in GxP computer systems.■
Leverage GenAI within existing process frameworks as an accelerator of existing
content development, with content subject to review and author ownership as before.■
Distinguish carefully between AI solutions used for insights and content
development, and those used for operations and automated decision making.
Ensure probabilistic systems are used for the former, and more tightly controlled and
deterministic frameworks are used for the latter.■
Protect company intellectual property by instituting data and security policy that
prevents company content from being used to train language models outside the
digital walls of the organization.■

Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2026, use of virtual assistants in 30% of life science
organizations will decrease the number of sales representatives while accelerating
business growth.
Analysis by: Animesh Gandhi
Key Findings:
Market Implications:Trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic lean toward digital engagement
among healthcare providers (HCPs), echoing the digital expectations set by
industries like retail. HCPs now expect a conﬂuence of digital and real-time
experiences.■
With the rise of specialty and rare disease treatments, life science sales
representatives face heightened pressures. They must be knowledgeable in
therapeutic nuances, navigate competitive market dynamics and identify trends in
complex purchasing environments. Additionally, they are tasked with strategizing
account interactions with diverse stakeholders and serve as the primary liaison for
HCPs.■
In therapeutic areas with limited clinical differentiation, life science marketers are
realizing that relying solely on the therapeutic product is no longer sustainable. The
emphasis is now on delivering additional value beyond mere clinical advantages.■
The role of sales representatives is no longer just about selling. It’s evolving, with a
growing emphasis on collaboration with diverse internal teams, adoption of data-
driven strategies and synchronizing across digital and analog customer touchpoints.
Consequently, as the complexity and breadth of the role have expanded, it has
become too demanding for many sales representatives to effectively do everything
well.■
While AI and natural language processing (NLP) present promising tools to enhance
sales efﬁciency, many CIOs remain cautious due to uncertainty about sales’
organization adaptation rate and associated operational costs.■
Traditional, deeply ingrained sales-driven methodologies are being challenged by
personalization, omnichannel orchestration, digitalization and AI. These challenges
are intensiﬁed by shifting customer preferences and rising access restrictions on
sales representatives, exposing signiﬁcant gaps in the conventional approach.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00803694 Page 11 of 18
Recommendations:While many life science organizations have already adopted AI-enabled “next best
action” tools to improve productivity, these technologies primarily offer passive
assistance with tasks such as prioritization, content selection and operational
reminders. The efﬁcacy of these technologies is directly dependent on their adoption
by sales representatives. However, VAs elevate AI-enabled automation in sales by
being seamlessly integrated into the roles of sales representatives. They not only
facilitate decision making but also play an active role in execution, beyond
automating simple activities like call and route planning.■
VAs will revolutionize the role of sales representatives, shifting from algorithmic
execution to adeptly navigating market uncertainties, utilizing data-driven
approaches and collaborating with business peers to deliver exceptional value to
their customers and drive business growth. VAs will enable this transformation
through the following areas:■
User interface: Transitioning from multiple point-and-click workﬂows across
systems to command-based conversational interfaces.■
Technology relationships: Evolving from passive support, governed by preset
rules, to an active collaboration characterized by dynamic, situational decision
support.■
Skill development: Moving from repetition-based mastery to experimentation
and adaptability.■
Forward-looking CIOs will partner with sales leaders to experiment and pilot with
VAs, enabling their organizations to enhance sales representatives’ efﬁciency, tailor
customer engagements, optimize resource allocation and maintain competitive
market advantage.■
Audit your current VA capabilities, examine your current sales processes, and
determine the relevance and alignment of VAs within those processes. Focus on
processes that address key pain points for sales representatives, such as updating
data, interfacing with multiple systems, and obtaining timely insights.■
Initiate VA as a minimum viable product (MVP) and deploy iterative new
functionality with feedback from sales representatives and other success metric
data.■

The majority of organizations manage sustainability reactively, focused on hindsight
reporting and mitigating environmental impacts as they arise. As pressure to be
more sustainable increases and ESG goals become more ambitious, organizations
are investing in proactive sustainability strategies to mitigate their impacts.■
The healthcare industry (including life science organizations), accounts for 4.4% of
global net emissions — more than aviation and shipping industries.14 The
pharmaceutical industry has been estimated to generate around 52 megatons of
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually, which is signiﬁcantly more than the
automotive industry.15 For more information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
see Industry Insights: Sustainability for Communications Service Providers.■
Seventy-ﬁve companies within the biotechnology, healthcare or pharmaceutical
industries currently have an emissions target being tracked by the Net Zero Tracker,
with 72% of the 75 being committed to Net Zero.16■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00803694 Page 13 of 18
Market Implications:Today, nearly 75% of life science emissions are tied to Scope 3.17 In addition, the
Scope 3 emissions stemming from purchased goods and services represents 61% to
80% of pharma company GHG emissions on average.18■
Across all industries, 80% of a product’s environmental impact is determined during
the initial design phase.19 Active pharmaceutical ingredients have been shown to
negatively impact soils, biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems, which also threatens
drinking water resources, which directly threatens the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (UNSDGs) of Life Under Water and Clean Water and Sanitation.20■
Pharmaceutical organizations are prioritizing circular economy initiatives, and
implementing circular design guidelines within R&D, such as Novo Nordisk and its
take-back program. Novo Nordisk’s take-back insulin pen initiative, piloted in
Denmark (2022), achieved a monthly average return rate of 18.3%.21■
Sustainability strategies will shift from being reactive to being proactive, and
environmental pollution impacts like waste, water and carbon emissions will become
embedded in business decisions. IT organizations will be asked to collect
information and implement solutions that enable researchers and engineers to make
more sustainable decisions in the R&D process.■
Pressure surrounding Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions will shift to focus speciﬁcally
on Scope 3 emissions, with most life science organizations targeting their upstream
activities.■
Life science organizations will select vendors based on their sustainability
performance and embed ESG performance targets into their vendor contracts.■
Pressure around active pharmaceutical ingredients, packaging and waste will push
sustainability goals far beyond just carbon. Along with GHG emissions, other
impacts such as water usage, packaging, circularity and logistics for products will
become critical.■
Pressure for increased transparency on product impact will require investment in
either life cycle analysis (LCA) or product carbon footprint (PCF) software. LCA tools
will be used to assess the impact of products on all realms of the environment,
whereas PCF tools will be used by more immature organizations solely focused on
carbon. Impact assessments will look beyond just the product and include other
functions such as clinical trials.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00803694 Page 14 of 18
Recommendations:
Related Research:Product life cycle management (PLM) and product information management (PIM)
software will be forced to adopt LCA or PCF capabilities to maintain competitive
advantage. These solutions will enable R&D teams and engineers to make impactful
design decisions while in the development stage.■
Simulating the changes in product design and delivery will require a range of
solutions to communicate data and analytics capabilities to capture “as is” for a
baseline of products, then identify new opportunities using modeling. This will
require IT groups to support data aggregation and analytics capabilities (both
internally on core systems, as well as with partners, suppliers, distributors and
channels to market).■
Advocacy groups are building awareness about how “dirty” pharmaceutical
manufacturing has become in areas of waste, emissions and environmental
pollution as aging populations increase product demand globally and
pharmaceutical recycling programs for unused medications face difﬁculties. The
exposome22 (i.e., environmental exposures) will see increased attention over the
coming years, demanding boards of pharmaceutical companies to take action.■
Unite systems of data across the product life cycle, including product life cycle
management (PLM), PIM, ERP and SCM, to support LCA and PCF analysis.■
Upskill sustainability beyond technology selection and explore how to leverage data
for critical enterprise initiatives, including Scope 3 emission reduction and product
sustainability.■
Evaluate the feasibility of product sustainability initiatives by performing a deep-dive
into GHG emissions, and determine which parts of the value chain connect to the
highest percentage of emissions. Widen the scope to consider water usage, waste
generation and recyclability, and prepare to perform LCA or PCF to assess products.■

A Look Back
In response to your requests, we are taking a look back at some key predictions from
previous years. We have intentionally selected predictions from opposite ends of the scale
— one where we were wholly or largely on target, as well as one we missed.
On Target: 2020 Prediction — By 2023, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices used
to augment existing clinical and commercial product monitoring, tracking and
management technologies will be used in 25% of the top 50 life science companies.
The 2023 Gartner Business Outcomes of Technology by Use Case Survey showed that
69% of life science respondents had already deployed, or were currently deploying,
wearable devices for clinical trials. Further, 57% have deployed, or are deploying, IoT for a
connected laboratory. These ﬁndings support our assessment that our earlier prediction
was successfully met, and surpassed.23
IoT adoption among life science organizations has been growing and scaling from
individual projects to organizationwide deployments. IoT sensors and devices have been
instrumental in transforming life sciences, enhancing monitoring capabilities and
optimizing product management. The COVID-19 pandemic was a notable driver of
adoption, where IoT sensors supported real-time data collection, remote patient
monitoring, streamlined clinical trials and more efﬁcient supply chain management.
Missed: 2020 Prediction — By 2023, life science business leaders will push AI into 50% of
enterprise core processes — exposing gaps in IT architecture, governance and skills.
The 2024 Gartner CIO and Technology Executive Survey showed that 43% of life science
respondents have deployed AI/ML within their organization.24 Although the level of AI in
life science organizations has signiﬁcantly increased and gaps in IT architecture,
governance and skills rings true, many AI/ML instances reported by clients are still for
niche functional areas or have limited use. For the most part, they are still not being used
for “enterprise core processes,” and it will likely take another 12 to 24 months before that
level is achieved. Further, in 2023 we witnessed a massive AI investment fueled by GenAI
advancements. The 2023 Gartner Business Outcomes of Technology by Use Case Survey
showed that already 38% of life science respondents were “currently
utilizing/experimenting with GenAI,” and a further 44% planned to in the next 12
months.23Industry Insights: Sustainability for Communications Service Providers ■

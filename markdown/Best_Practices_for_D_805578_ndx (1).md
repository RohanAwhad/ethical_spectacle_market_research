Sustainable device selection and governance maximizes valuable
resources and contributes to enterprise sustainability goals. I&O
leaders should use this research to determine where and how to
rationalize, retain and restructure for the circular economy at every
stage of the device life cycle.
Overview
Key Findings
Recommendations
I&O leaders responsible for reducing the environmental impact of endpoint devices must:Governments globally, though particularly in Europe, have introduced new
regulations focused on the sustainable management of end-user devices and e-
waste. This includes a category in the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability
Reporting Directive (CSRD) and emerging Digital Product Passport (DPP)
requirements.■
Most organizations are increasing refresh cycles to four and ﬁve years for employee
laptops and three years on mobile devices to capitalize on their useful life. Extending
their life span represents millions of dollars in potential cost savings and can defer
thousands of tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from manufacturing new
products.■
A recent Gartner survey of IT and business leaders found that Desktop as a Service
(DaaS) or virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) was one of the top 10 most widely
implemented initiatives to reduce IT GHG emissions.■

Introduction
Endpoint devices make up a signiﬁcant portion of IT’s overall GHG emissions footprint
and waste production within most enterprises. With the global, rapid acceleration of
digital business and the introduction of new compute capabilities, such as a neural
processing unit (NPU) for local AI workloads, the demand for new endpoints and
peripherals is continuing to grow at exponential rates.1 All of this consumption comes at
a steep environmental and ﬁnancial cost. As a consequence, managing the environmental
sustainability of endpoint devices is increasingly becoming a core responsibility and
priority for I&O leaders.
Ecolabel requirements and responsible disposal practices are now standard practices
globally for achieving a lower ecological footprint. However, they only address the
beginning and end of device life cycles and are ineffective at optimizing day-to-day asset
use and operations. Emerging regulations will require comprehensive reporting on the
total device life cycle.
Many I&O leaders don’t realize that the decisions they make
throughout the device life cycle — from procurement and shipping
to asset management and decommissioning — have a significant
impact in optimizing IT sustainability.Rationalize — Inventory what the organization has today, and utilize the full value of
these technologies by discovering and redistributing or responsibly recycling excess
resources.■
Retain — Extend endpoint life spans by using a performance-based approach to life
cycle planning, and reward employees and business units that demonstrate and
promote sustainable behaviors.■
Restructure — Prioritize suppliers with responsible practices and a comprehensive
set of sustainability service offerings, and shift to circular or consumption-based
computing models where feasible.■

Gartner clients have shared that strategic device sustainability decisions have resulted in
multiple indirect beneﬁts, including cost savings, process modernization, resilience and a
higher level of employee satisfaction and talent attraction. Achieving a sustainable device
life cycle is a critical business opportunity, and the circular economy (see Note 1) provides
a framework for pursuing such goals.
I&O leaders must use the IT circular economy to continually rationalize, retain and
restructure the complete device life cycle to equally serve the planet, engage employees
and support the business (see Figure 1).

Rationalize
As environmental regulation, geopolitical uncertainty, inﬂationary pressures and advanced
conﬁguration requirements complicate device acquisition, I&O leaders are challenged to
balance reducing excess equipment with continuously improving digital employee
experience (DEX). The good news is, these priorities can be balanced, and in some cases,
maintaining equipment for longer can have a net-positive impact on DEX. First, this
requires shifting the mindset of rationalization from reduction to maximization.
Reducing waste is not just about the environment. It’s also about maximizing cost-
effectiveness and efﬁciency by linking environmental beneﬁts to business beneﬁts.
However, these beneﬁts cannot be achieved without visibility into existing IT resources
and a strong asset management capability. Many organizations don’t realize the extent to
which they have overprovisioned endpoints to their employees, and have excess value
that has yet to be discovered or exploited. IT asset management processes must be
integrated with HR processes to avoid buying new devices where unused devices can be
redeployed instead.
Michigan Medicine created a Device Governance Workgroup to help ﬁnd, manage and
maximize use of endpoint devices. They found more than 4,000 devices (~10% of ﬂeet)
with low or no usage on a daily basis, representing an opportunity cost of $1.4 million.2
Unfortunately, this is a common phenomenon. Gartner research ﬁnds that about 30% of IT
hardware may be missing, lost or “ghosted” at any stage of the life cycle.3 This
contributes to excess e-waste, ﬁnancial loss, environmental ﬁnes and security
vulnerabilities.
Inventory Existing Assets
To avoid this scenario, I&O leaders must thoroughly inventory, catalog and identify assets
in their environment, which can be done through the following methods:
Use asset discovery tools or inventory data from uniﬁed endpoint management
(UEM) and IT asset management (ITAM) tools and compare with asset registers to
identify and recover “ghosted” devices.■
Use DEX tools to analyze utilization and performance data to identify unused or
underused resources that can be reallocated.■

The goal is to become circular — that is, to optimize device intake and use, not just
mitigate disposal. Take a critical look at the ratio of devices per employee. Once
calculated, optimize the number of devices per worker to ensure no one is wasting
underutilized resources.
Circularity is not an end-of-life process. There is a hierarchy of effectiveness between
circular processes, including reuse, repair, remanufacture and recycle (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: Device Waste Hierarchy
From a waste and emissions reduction perspective, reusing or repairing devices is more
effective than remanufacturing or recycling them. While all four approaches seek to
eliminate landﬁll waste, the latter options contain embodied carbon and energy impact,
and have the expense of additional labor and costs to decommission and procure new
equipment.Maximize return rates from leavers and employees who have had a refresh by
discussing take-back services with suppliers, in which they track the old laptop
and/or mobile phone and ensure it gets returned before being swapped for a new
one.■

“Circulate products and materials at their highest value. This
means keeping materials in use, either as a product or, when that
can no longer be used, as components or raw materials.”
— Ellen MacArthur Foundation
Retain
After reducing intake, the most effective strategy to reduce e-waste and carbon emissions
is to extend device life spans. Effectively capturing the sustainable beneﬁts of longer life
spans ﬁrst requires an understanding of how endpoint emissions break out according to
the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (see Note 2). Figure 3 shows how GHG emissions
break out for endpoints.
Figure 3: Device Emissions Footprint
Embodied carbon (Scope 3 emissions) from device manufacturing and transportation
make up the largest proportion of enterprise device GHG emissions.
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00805578 Page 7 of 20
The Scope 3 (cradle to site — see Note 3) carbon footprint must be accounted for upon
the initial purchase of equipment. Anything that can be done to encourage employees to
extend the life of their devices to limit the amount that is manufactured will be critical for
carbon emissions reduction targets and reducing avoidable e-waste.
To maximize device life cycles without impacting DEX or security posture, I&O leaders
should:
Extend Device Life Cycles Through Employee Segmentation and Analytics
Many organizations still refresh devices based on a ﬁxed (three- to ﬁve-year) expected life
span. These are often companywide standards that fail to account for different
requirements. While standard policies simplify budget and labor planning, they ignore
varying performance demands, usage patterns and device consumption.
Prematurely replacing devices with residual useful life wastes
money and time, and it increases e-waste.
To maximize the return on endpoint investments, I&O leaders must:Use an analytics-based approach to life cycle planning in place of traditional time-
based planning.■
Collaborate with HR, ﬁnance and security. Compliance and ESG peers to create and
enforce usage policies, behavioral expectations, norms and consequences for
noncompliance. The collective goal is to preserve power and maximize the return on
device investments.■
For people who don’t need a high-performing device, use refurbished and
remanufactured equipment to give devices a second life.■
Use usage and performance data from DEX tools or workplace analytics platforms
to know whether a device needs to be replaced.■
Use notiﬁcations and surveys to engage employees and collect sentiments related to
device performance and life spans.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00805578 Page 8 of 20
Beyond a life span of ﬁve years, most commercial-grade devices lose support and security
updates; exhibit higher component failure rates, slower performance and cosmetic wear
and tear; and consume more energy. Therefore, beyond ﬁve years, recycling for materials
and parts is often the optimal option.
Adjust Power State Configurations and Behavioral Expectations
The long-term reliability of a device often depends on how the employee treats and
maintains it. One of the ﬁrst things to fail and reach obsolescence on any device over time
is the battery. Therefore, actions employed to reduce energy consumption throughout use
will preserve the battery and avoid premature obsolescence.
The key is to conﬁgure devices to operate in the lowest power state required to perform.
For most devices, this means putting them in standby or a sleep state when they are not
being used and enabling other power-saving features. Expectations should also be set
with employees to power off or place devices in a sleep state to preserve energy when not
in use.
Pro Tip
Don’t frustrate employees and impact their work by being too aggressive with screen
timeouts and other power-saving settings. Start small, gather feedback and iterate
until you ﬁnd the right balance.
Remember that this is not about enforcement of IT policy, but rather how everyone must
work together to contribute to organizational sustainability goals. Collaborate with HR,
ﬁnance, ESG and compliance teams to deﬁne/update company policy, expectations,
norms and consequences around device health-span extension. Communicating key
goals and intended impact clearly gets everyone on board and engaged. This
responsibility can be distributed to the broader workforce through gamiﬁcation solutions
that reward employees with points, medals and stars when they exhibit sustainable
behaviors. The points can be exchanged for prizes, discounts or other forms of formal
recognition (see Drive Talent Outcomes With Manager-Enabled Rewards & Recognition).Use DEX tools (if available) to predict and proactively replace batteries and other
hardware showing symptoms of failure.■
Increase device conﬁguration options and deﬁne life spans based on personas (such
as hybrid/mobile, deskbound, frontline) with an optimized life span policy based on
their unique usage patterns and hardware requirements.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00805578 Page 9 of 20
To get increased employee engagement with IT sustainability, I&O leaders should:
Use Refurbished and Remanufactured Equipment
Reusing devices, through redeployment or remanufacturing, is another way to improve
ﬁnancial and environmental performance. Increased reports of companies signiﬁcantly
reducing hardware spend and e-waste are helping reduce the stigma around used
equipment. A remanufacturer relationship also allows the organization to mitigate new
device supply chain issues with a less competitive resource stream.
Refurbished/remanufactured equipment is not viable for all use cases and employees,
such as engineers or creative professionals who rely on high-performance computing.
Where requirements are moderate, a business case can be made. For example, a London-
based construction company, Balfour Beatty, used 5,700 remanufactured computers to
speciﬁc personas, which saved approximately 3,400 tons of CO2 emissions and over $1
million.4
“Firstly, our employees judge a machine on whether it works.
When I have asked employees, they were unaware they were using
a remanufactured laptop, as when they arrived, they were almost
indistinguishable from new.”
— Jon Ozanne, U.K. CIO of Balfour Beatty
To securely capture the cost, emissions and waste reduction potential that refurbished
products offer, I&O leaders should:Get buy-in from your workforce by educating them about the important contribution
to the environment they are making by using their devices for an additional year and
setting devices in sleep mode.■
Get rid of screen savers and set the power management settings on the devices to
allow them to go into a sleep state after a short period of idle use; ﬁve to 15 minutes
is common.■
Utilize employee rewards and recognition programs or software that helps get
employees involved and participating in best practices.■

Bonus: What can you do when you cannot extend the life of your device any longer?
When all avenues have been exhausted and decommissioning is necessary, I&O
leaders should:
Restructure
Organizations with a greater level of sustainability ambition can make hardware and
procurement choices that will have an even larger adaptive impact on the environment.Ensure refurbished equipment providers offer speciﬁc quality and environmental
certiﬁcations (e.g., BSI Kitemark, ISO 9001).■
Pilot and test remanufactured devices with select personas with lower performance
demands, such as task workers or customer support agents.■
Negotiate take-back and recycling strategies with the vendor at the forefront of the
deal to ensure full circularity after its second life.■
Ensure coverage of software, ﬁrmware, driver and updates to ﬁx bugs and security
issues for the entire expected life, as well as extended warranty coverage.■
Engage IT asset disposition (ITAD) service providers that have been certiﬁed by
recognized third-party auditors. The two most common and widely accepted
certiﬁcation bodies are e-Stewards5 and the Sustainable Electronics Recycling
International’s (SERI’s) R2 Standard.6■
Establish clear goals and metrics for e-waste collection and recycling, including
what percentage of assets have been reused, parts harvested or materials
extracted. There also needs to be established governance around who is held
responsible for bringing back the old devices. To rely on the willingness of
employees to send them back is not enough. See Improve PC Return Rates for
Remote Employees.■
Negotiate assurances and expectations that the ITAD service provider will
maintain full ﬁnancial responsibility and accountability for the collection and
proper recycling of e-waste as deﬁned by e-Stewards and SERI R2.■

Environmental sustainability must be a core buying criterion in every procurement deal.
This is more straightforward for laptops, desktops, monitors and peripherals, which are
shipped in responsible packaging (see Note 4) and have ecolabel certiﬁcations (e.g.,
Energy Star, EPEAT). Laptop, desktop and monitor models can also be compared by
accessing their product carbon footprint (PCF) data (see Note 5). Baseline testing can
also compare one laptop to another to determine the energy efﬁciency and calculate that
standard energy load within the organization’s unique environment.
Start by optimizing desk setups for sustainability. For example, using all-in-one docking
monitors with built-in webcams to avoid the added manufacturing and shipping of the
separate peripheral components can have signiﬁcant emissions reduction potential.
A 34-inch curved smart monitor (which can emulate dual-screen capabilities) has a
carbon footprint of around ~700 kg over a four-year life cycle. Compare that to a
traditional setup of two 24-inch monitors, a docking station, webcam, headset, laptop and
smartphone, which combined have ~1,100 kg CO2e over four years. That is approximately
a 61% savings in emissions (see Figure 4). These lower emissions conﬁgurations are
often lower in cost as well.
Figure 4: Optimized Desk Configurations

IT organizations can reduce their environmental footprint further by sourcing devices from
responsible providers. There is a growing number of IT equipment manufacturers joining
networks with the goal to share their sustainability performance data and receive a
sustainability certiﬁcation. Additionally, third-party providers such as EcoVadis help
buying organizations collect relevant data to assess their suppliers’ ESG performance (see
Market Guide for Supplier Sustainability Applications).
Pro Tip
When evaluating the different device sourcing options, consider vendors that
transparently share their sustainability performance data. This ensures suppliers have
invested in waste reduction and low-carbon device manufacturing.
The next step I&O leaders can take focuses on architectural and service delivery choices.
For example, virtual desktops accessed from thin clients have a smaller environmental
footprint than a laptop or desktop PC. Managed device life cycle services (MDLS, formerly
referred to as PC as a Service [PCaaS]) can ensure the environmentally efﬁcient tracking,
management and disposal of devices as a responsibility of the vendor. There are many
factors involved in those choices well beyond sustainability, but the GHG emissions
footprint and optimization are additional criteria to consider in that evaluation.
We have analyzed various device procurement and selection options and their associated
impacts. The following proﬁles only discuss their sustainability implications, not the full
scope of their risks and opportunities.
MDLS: Consistent IT Asset Management and Circularity
MDLS can enable circularity by returning end-of-life devices to the vendor who assumes
responsibility for asset disposal processes, which may result in resale, remanufacturing,
parts harvesting or recycling. MDLS is not necessarily the most sustainable solution. It is
often based on the acquisition of new products, rather than reuse of devices with
remaining life or refurbished devices. Lease-based MDLS often promote shorter lifespans
(two to four years), regardless of health or useful life.
Prematurely returning devices before they need to be decommissioned maintains a
modern ﬂeet of equipment but does not support sustainability goals. Additional energy
and resources are further used to package, ship, refurbish, reconﬁgure and redeploy
devices in a new environment. This ultimately contributes more to the growing waste
problem.
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00805578 Page 13 of 20
Recognizing this challenge, some MDLS vendors have started offering redeployed or
refurbished equipment instead of new. These offerings continue ﬁnancing terms, extend
support for driver and ﬁrmware updates and utilize analytics-driven performance and
health analyses. They ensure any older equipment is monitored and replaced as-needed.
This is an emerging option; therefore, feedback on the quality of devices and services is
still to be observed.
Recommendations:
Thin Clients and DaaS
For sustainability, we must consider the endpoint device and back-end data center GHG
emissions impact of DaaS (i.e., virtual desktops running in a public cloud environment).
Most organizations offer employees laptops for mobility purposes, but fail to realize that
most of the time laptops used at a desk are connected to a docking station and external
monitors. Whether working from an ofﬁce or home, deskbound workers who are not
reaping the mobility beneﬁts of a laptop may be able to use more efﬁcient devices. DaaS
enables use of ﬁxed thin clients, which have a signiﬁcantly lower manufacturing and
operational carbon footprint than laptops or desktops.
With fewer moving parts, thin clients also have a longer useful life span (six to eight
years). This further reduces embodied carbon over its life compared to laptops and PCs.
Compared to laptops, these devices also have greater uptime, less IT staff required to
support and the ability to swap hardware with minimal or no IT support required (thin
client software dynamically conﬁgures itself on boot).
Combined with DaaS, the life span of existing computers can also be extended by
repurposing them with a thin client operating system like iGelOS or ChromeOS Flex. These
OSs can run on thin clients that are 10+ years old, are compatible with all leading DaaS
solutions, are easier to manage and secure, require less power and can allow the use of a
device until the point of hardware failure. This will also enable a consistent OS across thin
clients and repurposed PCs.Ensure any extended/refurbished MDLS deals maintain full vendor support and
warranty coverage for the entire term.■
Avoid any potential user disruption by requiring vendors to clarify their
remanufacturing, recertiﬁcation and redeployment processes and to demonstrate
how analytics will be leveraged to ensure all devices meet performance standards.■

Pro Tip
Before disposing of devices that are not compatible with Windows 11, consider
repurposing them as thin clients.
DaaS is even more efﬁcient when operating on a consumption-based model in a cloud
provider’s data center, which is typically more efﬁcient than most on-premises data
centers.7,8 DaaS virtual machines running in energy-efﬁcient environments further
reduces the combined environmental footprint across the endpoint device and back-end
operations. VMs under pay-as-you-go offerings are automatically powered down when not
in use at night, on weekends and vacations.
Recommendations:
Bring Your Own Device/Bring Your Own PC
BYOD is complicated by its very deﬁnition — lack of corporate control. As a result, it
typically has just as many (if not signiﬁcantly more) environmental drawbacks as it has
beneﬁts. That being said, there are certain ways to achieve positive sustainability
outcomes from this model.
BYOD encourages employees to use their existing device resources to accomplish work,
while the organization often supplies the employee with a remote desktop solution to
access their corporate applications. This ultimately reduces the overall device load that
the organization is accountable for reporting on and measuring from an environmental
perspective, and it avoids contributing to the mass manufacturing of new endpoint
devices.If the organization uses or plans to use DaaS, identify personas whose work is
primarily done from a ﬁxed location (whether in ofﬁce or remote) to pilot or use
small/micro form factor PCs or thin/zero clients. See Segment IT Services by
Employee Lifestyles, Not Just Work Styles to segment and discover these employee
groups.■
Use DaaS alongside computers, repurposed as thin clients. ■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00805578 Page 15 of 20
Environmental beneﬁts can also be gained from enabling BYOD for short-term scenarios.
For a real-world example, instead of shipping a device to an employee upon hire, a large
business process outsourcer (BPO) advised new employees to temporarily use their own
devices, enabled and secured by a remote desktop solution for security, for a temporary
period before sending out a device. This ensured that employees who did not go to
training or left the organization shortly after starting did not cause unnecessary shipping
of company equipment and were only provisioned company resources after a speciﬁc
term.9 In this manner, BYOD can be used in the onboarding process to reduce
unnecessary shipping costs and the carbon impact of logistics.
The prevailing issue with BYOD in a sustainability context is not procurement or
management, but lack of control over its end of life. Employees are left with the
responsibility to properly dispose of equipment, and many lack the connections or
understanding of how to do so. To combat this, some organizations facilitate the disposal
of personal devices by raising awareness, putting out collection bins, establishing
agreements with providers who can dispose of the devices, and some even tie this to
reward programs for employees.
Recommendations:
Run educational campaigns for employees around the sustainable impact of their
devices, and help them ﬁnd channels for responsible recycling in their local areas.■
Organize company-sponsored, on-site e-waste collection events to encourage
employees to recycle any old and unused equipment.■
Incentivize employees using rewards and recognition for those who participate and
encourage their peers.■

Acronym Key and Glossary Terms
Managed
Device Life
Cycle
Services
(MDLS)MDLS refers to a service model in which customers pay for a
conﬁgured PC that is fully supported throughout its life cycle.
MDLS is an evolution of what was previously called PC as a
service (PCaaS) or device as a service (DaaS). The change to
MDLS was necessitated by the decoupling of life cycle services
from lease agreements and/or hardware procurement altogether
in most PC life cycle deals. Now, the deﬁnition reﬂects only the
end-to-end services offered alongside the device. This can be on
a purchased device or including hardware cost.
Desktop as a
service
(DaaS)DaaS solutions provide a virtualized desktop experience to
workers entirely from the public cloud. DaaS eliminates the need
for businesses to purchase the physical infrastructure associated
with VDI, instead of functioning through subscription- and usage-
based payment structures. DaaS includes provisioning, patching
and maintenance of the management plane and resources to host
workloads.

Note 1: The Circular Economy
A circular economy is an economic and environmental sustainability model that separates
the ability to achieve economic growth from the use of natural resources to generate that
growth. Traditional linear economies are based on a cycle that extracts resources,
produces goods and disposes of the product at the end of its useful life.
The linear model is often described as take-make-use-dispose — a cycle that ultimately
results in waste and depletion of resources. In contrast, a circular economy encourages
the design, making and continuous reuse and recycling of materials to engineer waste out
of the physical environments while preserving and regenerating raw materials and other
natural resources.
Note 2: GHG Protocol
The GHG protocol is the international standard for GHG emissions reporting, which breaks
emissions into three scopes:
Scope 1. Direct emissions from company-owned and operated assets. ■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00805578 Page 18 of 20
Note 3: “Cradle” Definitions
“Cradle” refers to the point at which minerals and materials are extracted from the earth
for use. The term designates when embodied carbon starts being calculated. After cradle
comes a series of subsequent boundaries for measurement, which include (in
chronological order) gate, site and grave.
 Circular Ecology deﬁnes these industry terms as follows:Scope 2. Indirect emissions associated with the electricity or steam a company
procures to power its operations.■
Scope 3. A broad category of emissions outside the direct control of the enterprise.
These include the embodied carbon in the manufacturing (cradle to site) of all
endpoints, packaging and eventual decommissioning operations (site to grave).■
Cradle to cradle — Goes beyond “cradle to grave” and conforms more to the model
of the circular economy. In a cradle-to-cradle model, products would be designed so
that at the end of their initial life, they can be readily reused, or recycled, and
therefore avoid landﬁll altogether.■
Cradle to gate — A boundary condition associated with embodied carbon, carbon
footprint and life cycle analysis (LCA) studies. A study ofto these boundaries
considers all activities starting with the extraction of materials from the earth (the
cradle), their transportation, reﬁning, processing and fabrication activities until the
material or product is ready to leave the factory gate.■
Cradle to site — A boundary condition associated with embodied carbon, carbon
footprint and LCA studies. A study to these boundaries includes the cradle-to-gate
results and the transportation of the material or product to its site of use.■
Cradle to grave — A boundary condition associated with embodied carbon, carbon
footprint and LCA studies. A study of these boundaries includes the cradle-to-site
results but also includes the GHG emissions associated with the use of the material
or product (maintenance) and the end of life (disposal, reuse, recycling).■

Note 4: Packaging
Packaging is not the most material focus area for reducing the environmental impact of
devices, but there are some things that you can do around packaging that are easy wins
and make a meaningful impact. Start by measuring the packaging you receive in volume
by weight.
Additionally, engage your vendor in conversations about multipacks. For example, when
you order 50 laptops or 100 laptops, the default will be individually packaged laptops on a
crate. That involves substantially more packaging material than multipacks. If they pack
50 laptops in a single bulk package on a crate, that will signiﬁcantly reduce your overall
packaging load. Lastly, have a conversation about the vendor taking the packaging back
for reuse to ensure the full circularity of the material.
Note 5: PCF Sheets
PCF sheets are not standardized in methodology; some calculate based on different life
spans or component inputs. Therefore, any comparisons across vendors should be
approached with caution.

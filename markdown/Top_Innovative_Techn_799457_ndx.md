Initiatives:Logistics and Fulﬁllment; Supply Chain Technology Strategy and Selection
Logistics technologies have different maturity and adoption levels,
beneﬁts, and risks, and they mean different things to different
supply chain domains and participants. The supply chain heat
map for transportation capabilities helps logistics leaders
understand impacts and prioritize investments.
Overview
Key Findings
Recommendations
Logistics and supply chain technology leaders responsible for transportation initiatives
should:The rise of innovative technologies in transportation is challenging logistics leaders
to evaluate their contributions to the supply chain transformation roadmap.■
These trends not only inﬂuence the end-to-end supply chain but also are often
initially adopted through application-speciﬁc and differentiated capabilities within
supply chain domains.■
Finding credible information on the most relevant and valuable innovative
technology trends is challenging for organizations with unique lines of business or
those pursuing new, nontraditional business models.■
Solicit suggestions for using innovative technology to improve and transform the
supply chain by establishing an internal ideation process to engage cross-functional
stakeholders to validate opportunities.■

Analysis
This research has been adapted from “Top Trends in Strategic Supply Chain Technology
2023.”
Supply chain technology is a source of competitive advantage, and supply chain
organizations are facing a wide range of technology options. These options include
emerging, growth, mainstream and legacy technologies (see Hype Cycle for Supply Chain
Execution Technologies, 2023).
Yet, the maturity level, adoption level, beneﬁt implications and even the overall
applicability of a certain technology capability, might differ given the supply chain domain
or even the supply chain’s role in driving value in the organization. A technology that could
have a huge impact for supply chain planning could have no relevance in transportation.
Therefore, it is important for logistics leaders responsible for transportation to understand
the differentiated, domain-speciﬁc impacts of the most innovative technologies and
trends, as well as to obtain background information on maturing technologies, practices
and processes.
This perspective lays the foundation for logistics leaders to decide whether to explore and
monitor these technologies, or invest in and act on them within the transportation domain.
Additionally, there may be value and competitive advantage gained by evaluating these
technologies and using them to reﬁne and tweak existing functionality as part of the
overall digital transformation strategy.
Strategic Technology Trends
Our top strategic supply chain technology themes for 2023 include the eight technology
trends shown in Table 1.Align transportation technology capabilities with the company’s business and IT
strategy by creating a governance structure that includes senior executive guidance
and bimodal practices — one focused on outcome predictability and the other on
new technology exploration.■
Evaluate transportation technology trends carefully by applying a rigorous vetting
process appropriate for experimentation or implementation to determine what is
reality versus hype.■

Transportation Perspective
Heat Map for Transportation Capabilities
Supply chain technology capabilities have a signiﬁcant impact on supply chain
operations and are the source of competitive advantage. As a result, supply chain
organizations must maintain a delicate balance between innovation for growth and
operational excellence that addresses today’s goals alongside their already established
technology infrastructure and systems. To balance growth and innovation with
operational improvement, transportation leaders must understand the true business
impact of these enabling technology capabilities. In the Table 2 heat map, we’ve classiﬁed
the business impact of each category of technology capabilities as follows: signiﬁcant
(XL), high (L), medium (M) or low (S).

Essential Trends for Transportation Capabilities
Historically, technology adoption in transportation has not kept to the same pace as
technology adoption in other supply chain functions. However, in recent years,
transportation and supply chain technology leaders have been prioritizing investment in
technology more to innovate, automate and enhance their operations and processes. As
logistics leaders consider the strategic supply chain technology trends, they should pay
particular attention to actionable AI and supply chain integrated services,as these are the
technologies that will have the greatest impact on the transportation function.

The impact of actionable AI on transportation continues to grow exponentially in both
scope of impact and importance. For logistics leaders in charge of transportation, utilizing
actionable AI provides actionable information that drives the decision-making process
that avoids disruptions and optimizes end-to-end transportation ﬁnancial and service
performance. Actionable AI can also be used to predict capacity demand, manage
inventory movements and optimize transportation asset and labor utilization among other
beneﬁts. For more information on AI in transportation, see Use-Case Prism: Artiﬁcial
Intelligence for Transportation.
Supply Chain Integration Services
Supply chain integration services (SCIS) has the ability to elevate the role of
transportation integration from a tactical, execution-centric and technical view of system
interoperability to a strategy-led vision of a more interconnected world. Interoperability is
both internal between a heterogenous portfolio of application and technologies as well as
external, with a growing ecosystem of trading partners.
For logistics leaders in charge of transportation, the opportunity here is to create a
comprehensive approach to the integration of different functions, processes and
stakeholders to optimize operations, reduce costs, enhance visibility and improve overall
performance. The goal is to create a seamless ﬂow of goods, supported by real-time data,
from production to the ﬁnal delivery to the end customer. In short, SCIS could enable
transportation operations to realize end-to-end performance advancement up to levels not
possible with siloed, manual processes.
Notable Mentions
Trends in transportation technology do not end with the two trends featured above. While
there has been focus and impact driven by those two trends, there are also several other
trends emerging and gaining in importance in the transportation technology space.
These emerging transportation technology trends include:
Composable applications: In transportation, composable applications facilitate data
ﬂows and streamline processes (e.g., control towers that use API event management
and integrated metrics to improve efﬁciencies and reduce costs). These applications
can also extend beyond organizational boundaries (with suppliers and partners) to
further optimize transportation networks.■

Carbon emissions calculation and accounting: Sustainability has become a priority
for supply chain organizations aimed at becoming carbon neutral and wishing to
avoid ﬁnancial penalties in regulatory compliance scenarios. Increasing pressures
from various external sources are accelerating the need to reduce emissions even for
companies without stated sustainability goals. As such, the innovation in both
stand-alone technology as well as embedding emission calculation functionality into
transportation execution technologies is growing in demand.■

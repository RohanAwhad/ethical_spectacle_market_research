Overview
Key Findings
Recommendations
To maintain and optimize existing data center infrastructure, I&O leaders must:
Introduction
The focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing resource
sustainability has been accelerated following the global pandemic as governmental
recovery plans are tying funding to sustainability goals. For I&O leaders, this means
introducing a strategy to reduce their organization’s carbon footprint (greenhouse gas
emissions), water consumption, resource utilization and e-waste management in data
centers.Sustainability-related materiality issues for data centers are energy consumption,
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scopes 2 and 3), e-waste and water consumption.■
Use of a renewable energy supply is critical to a net zero data center, but it is not
enough on its own. Achieving net zero will require addressing Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG
emissions.■
Net zero cloud services are very attractive to many I&O leaders facing major
investment in on-premises services. Be mindful not to conﬂate 100% renewable
energy with being net zero.■
Data centers running on carbon-intensive electricity grids, with little provision for
renewable energy, could become a stranded asset or will carry a ﬁnancial liability if
they are subject to carbon taxes or pricing.■
Implement an emissions reduction and sustainability program across all three
scopes within data centers by following the 7-point plan outlined in this research.■
Improve the I&O sustainability posture by moving more workloads to proven net zero
public cloud services, where possible, or to service providers with a clear path to net
zero targets.■
Reduce carbon emissions and water consumption with a net zero data center. ■
Actively implement a radical energy efﬁciency and emissions reduction plan that
falls in line with the enterprise net zero target or similar science-based targets.■

This mandate exists alongside pressure to cut costs and improve operational agility. The
alternatives are either elderly, less efﬁcient data centers or ones that cannot consume any
form of renewable energy, thus becoming a liability for business should emission
taxations be introduced. I&O leaders must continue to improve performance while also
reducing carbon and water consumption. This research introduces the concept of the net
zero data center and the proactive measures required from I&O leaders to achieve this
goal.
Before I&O leaders can begin to invest efforts into a sustainability program, they need to
understand the organization’s wider sustainability goals and initiatives. Often,
investments into data center infrastructure to achieve a net zero target — which requires
making step-change improvements in energy efﬁciency such as use of free air cooling or
investing in on-site cleaner energy generation — will be unjustiﬁable. Building new or
outsourcing to cloud or third parties may be a more attractive option, as long as the
providers also have a deﬁned net zero strategy with their delivery.
Emissions are broken down into three distinct scopes, the deﬁnitions of which can be
found in Figure 1.
Figure 1: GHG Emissions Scopes
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00750762 Page 4 of 8
Scope 1 is typically less than 10% of total emissions for a data center. Scopes 2 and 3 are
the most material issues for data centers. They will vary between data centers based on
many factors; but, generally, as a rule-of-thumb will be roughly equivalent.
Data center operations that claim to be carbon neutral (or similar) are usually referring
only to Scopes 1 and 2. To be net zero, according to the Science Based Targets initiative
(SBTi), will require neutrality across all three scopes.
Net zero requires implementing good circular economy practices (see Leading
Sustainability Ambition, Goals and Technology in the 2020s) and use of neutralizing
 carbon offsets. Table 1 contextualizes the emission scopes for typical data center
emission sources.

Implement a GHG Emissions Reduction and Sustainability Program for
Data Centers by Following the 7-Point Plan
To build and operate a net zero data center operation requires combining multiple
complementary practices. They will have a cumulatively balanced cost of operations and
the GHG emissions reductions across all three categorized scopes of emissions. While all
will be required, the mix will vary depending on location.
The 7-point plan:
There are many factors involved in choosing a location for a data center, of which
data residency is not the least. For net zero, it is imperative to locate data centers in
areas with environmental conditions that aid carbon emission reduction by requiring
less energy for cooling, allowing free cooling. Another option is to locate data
centers where there is an abundant supply of economically priced low-carbon (such
as nuclear) or renewable electricity.■
Not all renewable energy strategies are equivalent. They vary in their credibility.
Develop a renewable energy strategy that aligns to the enterprise’s values and
ambitions. That might include investing in net new capacity, power purchase
agreements, procuring Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates, or making use of on-site
generation technologies like CHP and fuel cells.■
Without impacting operational performance requirements, ensure high levels of
utilization are a key performance goal.■
Use higher-efﬁciency cooling techniques such as hot aisle/cold aisle conﬁguration,
ﬁltered free air cooling, Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis of airﬂow, high-
density racks, liquid cooling technologies, and increased environmental temperature
or groundwater/seawater heat exchanges. These techniques increase operational
efﬁciency and reduce the data center’s carbon footprint and operating costs.■
While not central to a net zero goal, water consumption can be a material issue for a
data center, particularly in areas of existing or growing water stress. Move water
consumption for cooling systems from potable mains fed to grey water sources
such as seawater, recycled water or rainwater collection systems.■
To address Scope 3 emissions, implement a circular economy strategy and program
(see Figure 2), ensuring materials recycling looks to extend the life assets, and
includes parts harvesting, refurbishment, and recovery of valuable and
environmentally sensitive materials.■

Figure 2: Defining the Circular Economy
The Beneﬁts of Moving Workloads to Greener Public Cloud Services
According to Gartner inquiries, public cloud providers can offer higher efﬁciencies in
economies of scale and server virtualization against on-premises infrastructure. Cloud
providers have a very strong ﬁnancial incentive to develop energy efﬁcient data centers —
many run data centers with a world-class power usage effectiveness well below Scopes 1
and 2. Some are going further and addressing their Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and
looking at making operations carbon neutral.Invest in suitable GHG emissions offsetting programs. While this will initially involve
both neutralizing and compensating offsets, it is likely a net zero data center will
need to rely on neutralizing offsets.■

Cloud services provide an opportunity for I&O leaders to consider migrating workloads to
platforms that will provide ready-made sustainability advantages. Some cloud providers
are including speciﬁc information on their sustainability initiatives and GHG emissions
footprint. The  Microsoft Azure Sustainability Calculator provides information on the
carbon footprint, and the  Google regional carbon emissions report and  AWS’s
environmental initiative portal give I&O leaders an understanding of how these
hyperscalers are approaching their sustainability efforts.
Cloud migration should not be considered as a stand-alone method of addressing GHG
emissions, but, rather, as part of a wider cloud strategy. Cloud providers should also be
assessed for their net zero data center initiatives to the same 7-point plan.
Actively Implement a Radical Energy Efﬁciency and Emissions Reduction
Plan Now
I&O leaders must consider their net zero data center project now, as data center migrations
can take at least six to nine months, and cloud migrations can take signiﬁcantly longer.
Recent announcements from the  U.S. administration, plus the ongoing initiatives from the
 EU, point to ambitious plans to address sustainability in their territories. These initiatives
will potentially be adopted around the globe. The IMF has  recently highlighted Canada’s
Federal Carbon Pricing Law as being a model for other countries to follow. All these
announcements point to further impetus to address sustainability at the C-suite level.
I&O managers in enterprises with a net zero target, or giving serious consideration to
similar science-based targets, should actively implement a radical energy efﬁciency and
emissions reduction plan.
In conclusion, I&O leaders should work with the organization’s overall sustainability goals
to reduce GHG emissions and prepare for continued government-driven initiatives to
enforce these changes.

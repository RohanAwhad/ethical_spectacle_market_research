Overview
Key Findings
Recommendations
Supply chain technology leaders responsible for transportation technology strategy and
selection should:End-user organizations often have very diverse transportation management system
(TMS) requirements. These can encompass multiple regions and business units,
complex transportation networks, and differentiated processes and service needs.■
TMS vendors typically support core capabilities, but their ability to support
international and extended capabilities varies signiﬁcantly.■
There is often further differentiation around the ability to support global rollouts and
different modes of transportation, such as parcel, ocean and rail. The depth and
breadth of a solution’s capability in areas such as transportation planning and
optimization increase in importance as a company’s operations increase in
complexity.■

What You Need to Know
This Critical Capabilities research should be used as part of an evaluation of TMS
products based on eight key differentiating functional capabilities across ﬁve major use
cases. This is a companion piece to Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Transportation
Management Systems, which compares vendors for their Completeness of Vision and
Ability to Execute.
The solutions evaluated have been selected from a wide range of TMS offerings and
provide off-the-shelf packages that require little to no customizations, but rather
conﬁgurations and extensions. This research is not focused on custom-built TMS
solutions and is limited to TMS solutions that are sold as stand-alone technology
offerings. Gartner showcases a heterogeneous mix of TMS vendors that reﬂects the
different requirements and preferences of users with various transportation complexity
levels.
Gartner highly recommends that you use the interactive version of this document. You can
use the interactive features to customize the use cases to suit your business needs and
requirements, and see which products ﬁt best. The factors Gartner has selected do not
represent all capabilities for a given TMS solution. Therefore, they might not represent the
most important capabilities for a speciﬁc use situation or business objective. Gartner
clients should use a Critical Capabilities analysis as one of several sources of input about
a product before making a decision.
Gartner deﬁnes transportation management systems (TMSs) as software that supports
multimodal planning and execution of the physical transport of goods across the supply
chain. It allows a company to manage varying levels of transportation complexity across
multiple transport modes and geographic regions. TMS solutions are utilized by
companies of differing sizes, operational complexity, industries and geographic locations.Identify signiﬁcant transportation challenges and needed technology capabilities by

Context
As a companion to the Magic Quadrant for Transportation Management Systems, this
Critical Capabilities report guides the selection for the corresponding TMS solutions, and
emphasizes the TMS product capabilities rather than the broader evaluation criteria of a
Magic Quadrant. Users of TMS solutions are typically transportation managers,
transportation procurement associates, and transportation planners and dispatchers.
This Critical Capabilities report focuses speciﬁcally on TMS products and has two
dimensions:
The overall vendor scores in this report will vary from previous versions. This is due to
changes in capabilities from the vendors, use-case weighting changes driven by buyer
requirements, and changes in the capabilities being scored. There were six previous
capabilities that were impacted by changes in 2024:Critical Capabilities: We have identiﬁed eight critical capabilities that consider
functionality, usability, technology, carrier networks, and implementation and support
proﬁciency.■
Use Cases: Not all critical capabilities are equally important, depending on certain
use cases. For this research, the use cases align with Gartner’s ﬁve-level
transportation stratiﬁcation model, where Level 1 transportation operations are
simple and usually involve mostly manual processes. Level 5 operations are
complex and organizations at this level are looking to automate as much of the
transportation process as possible. Each critical capability is weighted by use case,
and each vendor offering will be scored by critical capability. The difference in
weighting of the critical capability by use case will determine the total scores and
relative positioning of the vendors across the ﬁve use cases.■
Core and extended domestic capabilities were combined into a single critical
capability, core.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00791514 Page 19 of 35
In addition to changes in the evaluated capabilities, there were changes made to the
weighting assigned to the critical capabilities across all ﬁve use cases. These changes
were due, in part, to the previously outlined changes in the critical capabilities being
evaluated. These changes were also driven by Gartner inquiry with end users, and the
capabilities most often identiﬁed by organizations at the various levels of complexity.
Product demonstrations from the vendors included in this research heavily impacted their
individual critical capability scores.

Critical Capabilities Deﬁnition
Analytics
Analytics are rated based on the level of standard reporting provided, report creation
capabilities for users and available advanced analytics.
It includes adoption of various forms of analytics, like predictive or prescriptive, or
embedding of artiﬁcial intelligence capabilities, like machine learning. In addition,
capabilities to capture information and provide reporting on sustainability will also be
evaluated.
Gartner ﬁnds that organizations of all complexity levels rely on the embedded analytic
capabilities within TMS solutions. As complexity increases, the need for more data and
better decision making increases. However, large global organizations with high levels of
complexity may extract data from the TMS and utilize its own analytics and business
intelligence tools.
Gartner has seen a signiﬁcant increase in buyers looking to understand the sustainability
data capture and reporting capabilities of TMS solutions in the market.
Carrier Network
The network of carriers already connected to the TMS ecosystem is an important criterion
to consider. Carrier onboarding can be a long, time-consuming, resource-dependent and
costly effort.
End users need to keep this in mind during vendor selection, based on the size, complexity
and variety of their existing carrier network.
TMS vendors can have their own carrier network or partner with regional networks. TMSs
also recently started partnering with digital freight networks to provide not just carrier
integration, but also access to real-time rates and capacity. Some TMS vendors might
even have their own built-in digital freight network.
Core
Core TMS capabilities includes freight sourcing and procurement, planning, execution,
visibility, analytics and settlement of transportation shipments across multiple modes.
These modes include full truck load (FTL), less than truckload (LTL), private ﬂeet, parcel,
intermodal and rail.
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00791514 Page 23 of 35
These capabilities are applicable to international modes, such as ocean and air, as well as
the ability to combine the planning and execution of international and domestic legs
across regions.
However, given the emphasis placed on analytics and visibility by prospective buyers, they
are both evaluated as separate capabilities for the purposes of this research.
Because all TMSs qualifying for this research can handle core TMS capabilities to one
degree or another, solutions here are differentiated by the depth of capabilities in each of
the core functions. Differentiation can also come from advanced and enhanced
organization across these functions. For example, most solutions will offer some
planning functionality, but there is a differentiation in the depth of the optimization tools
used and scenarios supported.
Extended
Gartner considers extended TMS capabilities to be those functions that are adjacent to
core transportation management.
These include transportation forecasting, transportation modeling, 3D load building,
appointment scheduling/dock scheduling, private ﬂeet/vehicle routing and scheduling,
and parcel optimization and manifesting. These capabilities are applicable to
international modes, such as ocean and air, as well as the ability to combine planning and
execution of international and domestic legs across regions.
Vendors’ solutions are rated in extended TMS capability based on whether they cover
each of these and other extended functions, and on the richness of the features in each.
These functions become increasingly important as transportation processes and
networks move from Level 3 to Level 4 and Level 5 transportation operations.
International
International TMS capabilities include both core and extended capabilities, but add
additional functionality, including global multileg shipment planning and optimization,
freight forwarder connections, international transport bookings, and global trade
management.
Gartner ﬁnds that users are placing greater emphasis on these capabilities, speciﬁcally in
the Levels 4 and 5 use cases, when companies are seeking more complex global solutions
and international transportation plays an important role in their freight network.

Implementation/Integration Tools
Implementation/integration tools are rated based on the availability and ease of use of
standard tools to aid implementation and upgrading to a newer version of the product.
Focus is also on system interface and integration technologies supported, and the ease of
integration with third-party applications and systems.
This rating also includes the capabilities to support a customer with a domestic or global
implementation, which is based on available implementation resources and/or an
ecosystem of implementation partners. Quality of tools and capabilities are delivered
within the TMS to facilitate implementation, ongoing technical and application support,
and enhancements.
In the past, TMSs have been time-consuming and expensive to implement. In addition,
upgrades were also time-consuming, and many companies were often stuck several
releases behind on aging versions of the TMS.
User Experience
User experience is rated based on features and functions, such as adopted responsive UI
design, workﬂow management tools, visualization capabilities, differentiation between UI
for operators, supervisors, back-ofﬁce and managerial roles.
This also includes the ability of users to customize their primary work screens with
widgets and drag-and-drop functionality. Additionally, it includes the ability of users to
navigate and utilize the TMS functionality in a streamlined manner. This includes the
complexity of various processes, the number of steps or “clicks” required to complete an
action, and the overall ease of use for new users. Availability of tools, such as rule
engines, the ease of conﬁguration capabilities and workﬂow management, are also
considered. Other features under evaluation include search capabilities, social tools,
applications or functionality to enable collaboration across the TMS users and mobile
applications.
Gartner ﬁnds that users are placing greater emphasis on the user experience of the TMS
across different classes of employees. Issues like personalization, user onboarding and
capabilities to make the system more appealing to new and different types of users, are
important. While this impacts organizations operating lower levels of transportation
complexity to a higher degree, Gartner ﬁnds that even larger and more complex
organizations evaluate user experience in their product evaluation criteria.

Visibility
Visibility is milestone activity triggered by status events offered as track-and-trace
functionality.
Importance is placed on the capabilities a TMS can deliver to provide better visibility into
what is going on closer to real time during transport execution. It also provides visibility
into the advanced capabilities the TMS offers, such as predictive ETA insights or
enhanced decision making.
Consideration is given to the degree of visibility offered natively within the TMS solution
versus through ecosystem partnerships.
Gartner ﬁnds that users are now looking beyond just basic transportation execution and
milestone updates. They place more importance on the capabilities a TMS can deliver to
provide better visibility into what’s going on in real time during the transport execution.
Use Cases
Level 1 Complexity
Level 1 transportation complexity organizations typically have a fragmented operational
focus.
There are limited transportation capabilities, typically A to B type of movements involving
one mode of transport. Additionally, it’s where the transportation capabilities are focused
on the execution of the shipment in a domestic environment. TMS capabilities are mostly
manual, such as simple mode and carrier selection at order entry time. Normally, these
solutions support a fraction of an enterprise’s transportation activities.
Level 2 Complexity
Level 2 transportation complexity organizations typically have an execution-centric
operational focus.
The focus is primarily on the execution aspects of over-the-road (OTR) transportation,
tendering shipments to carriers. This level provides limited and rudimentary planning
capabilities but offers a more dynamic selection of modes and carriers than Level 1.
Organizations at this level usually rely on minimal transport modes, primarily FTL and
LTL, and will have a single country/regional focus. Basic systems provide some electronic
data interchange (EDI) tendering. More robust solutions add carrier portals, whereby email
messages or webforms are used to electronically tender to non-EDI-capable carriers.

Level 3 Complexity
Level 3 transportation complexity organizations shift to an expanded footprint operational
focus.
Solutions provide further capabilities for planning, execution, monitoring and settlement.
Capabilities begin to extend to operational and tactical planning, visibility, freight rating
and carrier contract management, settlement, and some freight analytics. Options for
consolidation, and carrier selection and evaluation, during planning are available.
Operational planning improves, usually for a single direction (outbound or inbound).
Support for additional modes of transportation is introduced, such as parcel, intermodal,
rail, air and ocean. It offers minimal support to identify backhauls and round trips.
Level 4 Complexity
Level 4 transportation complexity organizations expand to an advanced planning
operational focus.
Solutions introduce sophisticated planning features focused on improving mode
selection, load consolidation, routing and carrier selection. Solutions allow for
simultaneous consideration of inbound, intraenterprise, and outbound shipments in a
single planning and execution environment. Strategic transportation capabilities to exploit
more opportunities by combining loads, building round trips, and continuous moves or
advanced concepts, such as pool and ﬂoating pool-point distribution, are available.
Solutions provide further capabilities for freight procurement, bid optimization,
forecasting and tactical freight capacity planning along with more robust analytic
capabilities. At this level, solutions are often used to centralize transportation planning
with the most advanced shippers.
Level 5 Complexity
Level 5 transportation complexity organizations emphasize a global transportation and
logistics operational focus.
Multileg shipments for cross-border operations, considering multiple modes of
transportation, carriers, and other stakeholders, such as customs brokers, across one
single shipment record become common. Requirements for additional capabilities, such
as global trade management and international transport bookings, increase. Solutions
support multiple languages, currencies, geographies and other international features, such
as international transportation documents, data formats, postal codes or equipment types
and sizes.

ratings in Table 2 by the weightings shown in Table 1.
Evidence
The following were used to collect information about the vendors and their TMS offerings:
Vendor presentations and demonstrations to the Gartner analyst team:
Speciﬁcally, to support this research, each vendor presents information about its
company and solutions. Each vendor was provided a product demonstration script
and allotted time to demo the various capabilities and functionality. Each vendor is
allotted the same amount of time for this research, but Gartner also conducts
interactions with vendors throughout the year as part of normal and ongoing
relationships with user and vendor clients.■
Research and data collection: Each vendor is also asked to respond to and ﬁll out a
survey that investigates, in more detail, factual information about its company and
TMS offering. Also, as part of this exercise, Gartner reviews customer references on
Gartner Peer Insights submitted in the past 12 months.■

Critical Capabilities Methodology
This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of
products or services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance
for speciﬁc product or service use cases. Next, products/services are rated in terms of how
well they achieve each of the critical capabilities. A score that summarizes how well they
meet the critical capabilities for each use case is then calculated for each product/service.
"Critical capabilities" are attributes that differentiate products/services in a class in terms
of their quality and performance. Gartner recommends that users consider the set of
critical capabilities as some of the most important criteria for acquisition decisions.
In deﬁning the product/service category for evaluation, the analyst ﬁrst identiﬁes the
leading uses for the products/services in this market. What needs are end-users looking to
fulﬁll, when considering products/services in this market? Use cases should match
common client deployment scenarios. These distinct client scenarios deﬁne the Use
Cases.
The analyst then identiﬁes the critical capabilities. These capabilities are generalized
groups of features commonly required by this class of products/services. Each capability
is assigned a level of importance in fulﬁlling that particular need; some sets of features
are more important than others, depending on the use case being evaluated.
Each vendor’s product or service is evaluated in terms of how well it delivers each
capability, on a ﬁve-point scale. These ratings are displayed side-by-side for all vendors,
allowing easy comparisons between the different sets of features.
Ratings and summary scores range from 1.0 to 5.0:
1 = Poor or Absent: most or all deﬁned requirements for a capability are not achieved
2 = Fair: some requirements are not achieved
3 = Good: meets requirements
4 = Excellent: meets or exceeds some requirements
5 = Outstanding: signiﬁcantly exceeds requirements
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00791514 Page 34 of 35
To determine an overall score for each product in the use cases, the product ratings are
multiplied by the weightings to come up with the product score in use cases.
The critical capabilities Gartner has selected do not represent all capabilities for any
product; therefore, may not represent those most important for a speciﬁc use situation or
business objective. Clients should use a critical capabilities analysis as one of several
sources of input about a product before making a product/service decision.

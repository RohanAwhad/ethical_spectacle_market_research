Initiatives:Executive Leadership: Driving Sustainability; Corporate Strategy Leadership
Overly complex sustainability plans result in inertia, delayed
performance and future carbon liabilities. Executive leaders must
simplify their strategies in the right places to realize both ﬁnancial
and nonﬁnancial beneﬁts.
Achieving sustainability goals is a complicated task, and there is no single blueprint for
success. Executive leaders must orchestrate strategies across multiple business
processes, stakeholder groups and products to create value for the enterprise. These gains
can be ﬁnancial, through offering sustainable products and services, or nonﬁnancial, as a
result of improved resilience or reputation.
All too often, however, overly complex sustainability strategies erode value rather than
create it. Complexity in itself is not necessarily bad. But organizations must distinguish
between two types and their differing impacts:
Value-constraining complexity is costly and fuels inertia in sustainability strategies.
Symptoms include an overreliance on subject matter experts in decision making,
simultaneous execution of too many activities and insufﬁcient alignment of goals
with business outcomes. Organizations facing these challenges may deprioritize
sustainability initiatives — as 64% of supply chain leaders regularly do during
disruptions or for other long-term risks.1 Alternatively, they must dedicate additional
resources to achieve their objectives.■
Value-enabling complexity gives the organization a strategic advantage by aligning
sustainability with enterprise outcomes. This sort of complexity may take the form
of extra due diligence, for example, when conducting mergers and acquisitions
(M&A), to understand how they affect the organization’s ability to achieve its
sustainability goals. Or, the added value could come from synthesizing datasets to
empower decision making.■

Historically low interest rates after the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2007-2009 meant
executive leaders sometimes failed to notice the value-constraining complexity in their
sustainability strategies. They must now maximize value by simplifying their plans in four
ways (see Figure 1):
Figure 1: 4 Simplification Tactics to Address Value-Constraining Complexity in
Sustainability Strategies
Rationalize Goals
Not all sustainability objectives are equally crucial. Having too many of them, or failing to
understand their relative importance, dilutes effort and action, and means goals that drive
business value do not receive enough attention. For example, reducing greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions may link directly to the organization’s product strategy, helping to boost
revenue, and should be a higher priority than lower-impact sustainability targets.Rationalize goals ■

Rationalizing goals frees up time and resources to concentrate on what matters. Executive
leaders can:
Be mindful that constantly rationalizing sustainability goals will result in stakeholders
questioning the enterprise’s commitment and focus.
Leverage Rules to Guide Decision Making
Many companies regard sustainability as an afterthought, with only 12% of business
leaders saying it is fully embedded and operationalized in their decision making.4
Integrate sustainability into business decisions, but don’t slow them down by relying on
excessive amounts of data or expert advice.
Bust sustainability inertia with two actions:Recalibrate publicly — An organization may need to reset overly ambitious
sustainability targets or streamline areas of focus. While such a step is not without
ﬁnancial or reputational risk, it is better than consistently performing poorly and
missing goals. To maintain stakeholder trust, provide clear justiﬁcation for any
changes. For example, the U.S. footwear company Crocs now aims to achieve net-
zero emissions by 2040, a decade later than its previous target of 2030. Crocs said
the revised timetable reﬂects its acquisition of HEYDUDE and the completion of a
baseline assessment of its GHG emissions.2,3■
Reprioritize internally — Executive leaders must rank sustainability goals based on
stakeholder expectations and business outcomes, but the link between objectives
and results is often not well understood. Only 29% of supply chain leaders say
internal business partners see the connection between sustainability and improved
risk management, while only 32% think these partners see the link with improved
business performance.1 Provide evidence of ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial beneﬁts of
implementing the sustainability strategy. These gains range from improvements in
operational performance (cost saving, resilience, employee engagement) to market
differentiation (reﬂected in increased sales). Deﬁne where accelerated versus
incremental goal delivery is needed.■

Figure 2: Apply Decision-Making ConstraintsThink long term — Don’t try to build sustainability into all decisions. Concentrate on
those that guide the enterprise onto sustainable long-term pathways, such as M&A
transactions, R&D, capital investment and supply chain management. Deﬁne what
sustainability decision criteria apply to each process. For example, Synthomer, a
U.K.-based chemical products company, built a sustainability impact scorecard into
its R&D process to steer projects and portfolios toward positive sustainability
profiles.■
Apply decision constraints — Spending too much time over a decision and asking
for too much information leads to inaction. Reduce delays by using a framework like
the one shown in Figure 2. Limit the time for discussion and deliberation, clearly
deﬁne the data needed to avoid unnecessary additional requests, restrict the use of
escalation and clarify when to use experts. Review the effect of decisions today on
your organization’s long-term ability to achieve sustainability goals.■

Clarify Responsibilities for Goal Delivery
Relying solely on the goodwill of individuals and teams with a special interest in
sustainability will yield only incremental improvements. To make the sustainability
program a strategic priority, its objectives need to be relevant at a team and department
level. Map priority targets to departments and, where viable, roles. Remember that setting
annual or quarterly sustainability performance goals without allocating ﬁnancial and
human resources will lead to disillusionment and a lack of engagement.
Executive leaders should:
Reassess External Relationships
Organizations cannot achieve ambitious sustainability goals in isolation. Collaboration
with external partners can unlock new technology, business value and ways of working.
But such cooperation risks becoming a time sink rather than a strategy enabler. Executive
leaders need to proactively:Target hot spots — Apply the Pareto principle — which asserts that 80% of outcomes
result from 20% of all causes — to identify which departments or external
stakeholders (such as suppliers) can make the most signiﬁcant contribution to
enterprise sustainability goals.5 Expect more from them, and allocate resources
accordingly. For example, Danish-Swedish dairy company Arla introduced a
sustainability incentive model to reward farmers for reducing their GHG emissions.
Arla hopes the initiative will help it reach its goal of reducing carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e) emissions from farms by 30% per kilogram of milk by 2030.6■
Define accountabilities — Build sustainability metrics into individual key
performance indicators, and tie remuneration and bonus policies to performance in
this area. U.K. retailer Tesco linked 25% of executive pay, through its performance
share plan, to achieving sustainability targets related to carbon and food waste
reduction and diversity, equity and inclusion goals.7,8■
Reevaluate partnerships — Assess the value gained to date and the expected beneﬁt
in the next 24 months. Interrogate the reasons why a collaboration is not delivering
value, such as an insufﬁcient investment of time by the enterprise or a lack of clear
prioritization by the partnership. Either examine how to course correct the
relationship, or look to exit.■

Continue to review partnerships based on their impact. For those that don’t work, leave on
good terms to retain the option to return to them in future.

Evidence
1 2023 Gartner Balancing Sustainability and Resilience Survey. This survey was ﬁelded
from February to March 2023, across two and a half weeks. Responses were received
from 336 supply chain leaders and sustainability experts across 13 major industries and
four major regions. The majority of respondents were concentrated in North America and
EMEA (a combined 92%) and represented companies with annual sales of $1 billion or
greater (a combined 82%). Sixty-ﬁve percent of the respondents represented publicly
traded companies. Respondents answered questions on their business’ progress toward
sustainability and key business outcomes such as experienced disruptions, data-driven
approaches to sustainability, ecosystem collaboration, and transformation of the physical
supply chain. They were also assessed on attitudes and opinions such as barriers and
motivations to implementing sustainability, their priorities, whether they perceived
sustainability as having inherent business value, and whether they viewed sustainability
as part of their job.

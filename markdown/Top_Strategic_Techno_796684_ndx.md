Leadership
Technology is a necessary and powerful tool for delivering
sustainability-related outcomes at scale. IT leaders must harness
sustainable technology to improve the sustainability of IT and
enhance business sustainability with IT.
Overview
Opportunities
Recommendations
IT leaders should use sustainable technology to:Generative AI has brought concerns about energy consumption and the interrelation
between technology and sustainability to the fore. AI has the potential to scale
positive sustainable outcomes, but only if applied to the right use cases, such as
autonomous recycling and emissions measurement.■
Social and environmental responsibility are key drivers for attracting and retaining
next-generation talent and customers. Organizations can outperform competitors by
engaging with stakeholders through technology-enabled sustainable products and
services.■
Established technologies, such as ERP, cloud computing and AI, can be used to
improve sustainability. However, using a new framework of sustainable technology
will further elevate the sustainability efforts of IT, the enterprise and customers.■
Make IT more sustainable. Identify and remediate inefﬁcient infrastructure, IT
operations and software by managing the energy and carbon efﬁciency of IT
infrastructure and workplace services.■

IT leaders are consistently being tasked with using technology to drive environmental,
social and governance outcomes within and beyond the business. In Gartner’s 2022
sustainability survey, 90% of executive leaders agreed that digital technology is essential
to improving sustainability.1
However, current information technologies still have only an early-stage reliable open
telemetry capability for capturing the necessary performance and efﬁciency data, and for
assessing IT’s ecological footprint. This is further complicated by the fact that powerful
technologies, such as AI and blockchain, also have a large environmental footprint.
Sustainable IT is a balancing act between driving higher business performance and not
adversely hindering sustainability goals.Help the rest of the enterprise become more sustainable. Maximize positive
environmental, social and governance impact by reviewing the enterprise materiality
strategy and prioritizing sustainable technology investments on the issues identiﬁed
as most important to achieving long-term sustainable business performance.■
Help customers become more sustainable. Enable customers to measure, track and
improve their sustainability impact by using digital solutions to provide new
products, services and capabilities.■

To ensure organizations can achieve this balance, regulations and consortiums are
emerging across the globe to both challenge and help IT leaders track their sustainable
technology performance. For example, the  Green Software Foundation (GSF) and
 Responsible Computing Consortium are made up of members from leading technology
vendors committed to standardizing sustainability metrics across IT. Other regulations,
such as the EU’s  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), will require the use
of technology to help enable real-time measurement and tracking of both digital and
operational environmental performance. As these standards mature, sustainable
technology will become a necessity from both a regulatory and commercial standpoint
(see Figure 1).

Description

Sustainability covers social, economic and environmental impacts. It involves making
decisions about the use of technology and business practices that support long-term
ecological balance and human rights.
Sustainable technology is a framework of digital solutions that can be used to enable
environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes. It consists of:
Why Trending
The use of digital technologies, such as AI and cloud computing, is driving more concern
about the energy and environmental impacts of such innovation. Gartner predicts that, by
2027, IT leaders will begin facing electricity shortages because IT’s relentless increase in
demand for electricity will outpace the production and supply of energy sources (both
renewable and nonrenewable). This makes sustainable IT even more critical, thus driving
greater environmental performance.
As IT and executive leaders act on sustainability objectives, they simultaneously gain
indirect beneﬁts from these strategies. For example:Environmental technologies that prevent, mitigate and adapt to risks in the natural
world■
Social technologies that improve human rights outcomes, well-being and prosperity ■
Governance technologies that strengthen business conduct, oversight and capacity
building■
Seventy-four percent of IT and executive leaders agree that sustainability is
increasing their enterprise’s overall digital maturity (see Note 1).■
Eighty-six percent agree that sustainability investments protect from disruptions
(e.g., long-term renewable energy contracts can insulate organizations from energy
price ﬂuctuations).■
Forty-two percent of organizations drive innovation, differentiation and create
strategic value from sustainability initiatives.1■

The increasing demand for sustainable transparency has required greater monitoring and
telemetry data collection with, for example, observability platforms, digital employee
experience (DEX) tools and data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tools. It has
also required the use of ERP to track and maintain performance. The visibility these
technologies offer extends value beyond sustainability, providing the insights necessary
for improving overall IT performance.
From an operational standpoint, new processes designed with sustainability as a key
consideration have improved vendor/resource independence and provided greater cost
efﬁciencies. They have optimized consumption, harvested value from waste and returned
it to the business. Additionally, digitally-enabled employee engagement and customer
marketplace platforms scale sustainable practices and incentivize stakeholders to
contribute, both socially and environmentally.
The strategic beneﬁts of sustainable technology can signiﬁcantly outweigh its potential
drawbacks if executed successfully. IT leaders must harness the opportunities
sustainable technology presents to improve three critical areas of the business:
Implications
Internal IT Operations
Using sustainable technology to improve the internal IT ecosystem ensures that leaders
can efﬁciently meet sustainability goals. This means working with the right tools,
hardware and vendors that deliver the maximum possible output using the minimum
viable resources that help reduce IT greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This also entails
focusing on critical subjects, such as human rights, ethical sourcing and supply chain
transparency.
Solutions may include moving to more dynamic and efﬁcient methods for balancing
power distribution in data centers. For example:Internal IT operations (making IT more sustainable) ■
Enterprise operations (helping the enterprise become more sustainable) ■
Customer operations (helping the world become more sustainable) ■

Enterprises using sustainable technology to improve IT operations may also beneﬁt from
new procurement models and services for IT delivery. Examples include consumption-
based models that tie costs to resource utilization and performance analytics software
that manages equipment life cycles and defers premature hardware refreshes, avoiding
unnecessary spending and e-waste.
Enterprise Operations
Sustainable technology further enables leaders to look beyond the IT organization to
advance ESG goals across the business.
For example, Cisco has reevaluated its approach to the role of real estate in its San Jose
ofﬁces, using technology and networking solutions to reduce ofﬁce building demands on
the environment. Cisco ran a proof of concept on a Connected Workplace project, which
addressed environmental sustainability by reducing the number of redundant electronic
devices per employee. As a result, Cisco reduced equipment wattage and e-waste
disposal.4
Beyond simply using IT to make the enterprise more sustainable, individual employees
can also use technology to adopt and scale sustainable practices themselves. For
example, P&G enabled employees working from home with a Sustainability@Home virtual
channel to share videos with one another about eco-conscious habits. P&G posted several
of these videos on its social media accounts to promote and encourage these behaviors,
which were liked and reposted by employees and customers.5
Customer Operations
Creating a sustainable business is about more than ensuring that the enterprise
responsibly manages its resources. It’s also about enabling customers with sustainable
products and services that will help them become more sustainable by association.T-Systems used predeployed power distribution features in its hybrid cloud for rack
deployments. This enabled local staff to perform power delivery additions, changes
and removals easily and without the need for more electricians or customer
disruption.2■
Vodafone used DCIM software as a sustainable technology solution to plan,
measure and document sustainable data center operations. This helped Vodafone
do a 4-to-1 server consolidation that saved 75% of power in its facilities, which
helped defer building new ones.3■

For example:
Extending sustainability beyond the enterprise requires an understanding of customers’
key priorities and a balancing of their sometimes conﬂicting desires. For example,
customers may want a sustainable product, but are unwilling to compromise on quality
and cost. Customers need easy ways to become sustainable and to see how these
methods contribute to their goals.
ActionsAgroScout has developed an AI system that gives food processing companies, farm
managers and farmers control of climate management. This system fuses satellite,
multispectral and agronomic images into an agro-data bank. It detects ﬁeld stress
anomalies and veriﬁes the ﬁndings with data, turning them into reports and
dashboards on ﬁeld crop health and supply risks. Customers have saved up to 85%
on pesticide use as a result.6■
BMW started working with city planners to help reduce emissions — 60% of the
world’s population lives in cities and urban areas, generating 70% of GHG emissions.
BMW and the city planners used machine learning models to predict how trafﬁc
regulations can help reduce trafﬁc emissions.7■
Contextualize the issues that your enterprise has identiﬁed as most important for
long-term social and environmental performance by reviewing its materiality
assessment (see Note 2).■
Review the current ecosystem of technology and determine where investment in
further digital solutions is needed.■
Examine the following technologies that could help drive sustainability in your
industry, and invest in one or more that you identify as material for the business and
key stakeholders:■
Cloud services: The elasticity of cloud service models enables organizations to
use only what they need, which increases utilization rates of shared resources
and reduces environmental impacts.■

About Gartner’s Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024
This trend is one of our Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. These are the trends
we consider most relevant and impactful. Our trends fall into three main themes:AI for sustainability: This can improve business operations and optimize difﬁcult-to-
abate processes to reduce the organization’s carbon and environmental footprint
and mitigate material risks. AI can be made environmentally sustainable with the
use of AI techniques that help create and run models at the lowest carbon footprint
without compromising accuracy. This extends to the use of AI to monitor, predict,
mitigate and improve environmental issues in a way that can offset the negative
impacts of AI training.■
Sustainability and ESG software: This consists of sustainability-related data
discovery, collection, analysis, insight and reporting tools, which may take a variety
of forms. For example:■
Supplier sustainability applications help companies assess suppliers’ ESG
performance.■
Life cycle analysis software enables the end-to-end assessment of
environmental impacts of products, assets or services by reducing the
complexities of collecting data and enabling organizations to assess trade-offs
and make quicker strategic decisions.■
Use the  Hype Cycle for Environmental Sustainability, 2023 to ﬁnd the right balance
between well-established and leading-edge technologies for your enterprise’s
sustainability.■
Protect your investment. Preserve your investments and secure the beneﬁts from
past and future strategic technology decisions to make them durable.■
Rise of the builders. Unleash creative powers by using the appropriate technology
for the appropriate functions.■

These technology trends don’t exist in isolation — they interconnect (see Figure 2) and
several fall into more than one theme. The trends’ potential importance for your
organization differs by organizational maturity, but also by industry, business needs and
previously devised strategic plans.
Work with other executives to evaluate the impacts and beneﬁts of our trends. This will
enable you to determine which single trends — or strategic combination — will have the
most signiﬁcant impact on your organization, and the ecosystem in which it operates.
Examine the trends’ potential relative to your organization’s speciﬁc situation, factor them
into your strategic planning for the next few years, and adjust your business models and
operations appropriately.

Note 2: Materiality Assessments
Organizational materiality assessments are guides for identifying the issues that are most
important to stakeholders, and those that have the most signiﬁcant impact on the
business. Issues identiﬁed as having the highest business impact and being stakeholder
priorities are the organization’s non-negotiables. Begin with the top three issues and, if
possible, prioritize issues further down the list. Update materiality assessments annually
to ensure that sustainability priorities align with business needs and stakeholder
expectations.Respondents with an average level of digital maturity agreed/strongly agreed with
three to ﬁve of these characteristics.■
Respondents with a low level of digital maturity agreed/strongly agreed with less
than three of these characteristics.■

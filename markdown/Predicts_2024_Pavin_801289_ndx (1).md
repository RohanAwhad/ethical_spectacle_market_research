Initiatives:Executive Leadership: Sustainability; CIO Impact on Digital Business Strategy
and Execution
Increasing regulation and market requirements are magnifying the
business impact of sustainability risks and opportunities. Executive
leaders need to project the ways in which the upcoming changes
will disrupt their industries and use this insight to their competitive
advantage.
Overview
Key Findings
More-prevalent electricity rationing across the world will alter the competitive
dynamics in various industries, favoring enterprises that are capable of intelligent,
energy-aware operations.■
As a natural resource, water will become more scarce and expensive for enterprises
to consume, accelerating the development of new conservation techniques and
planning methods.■
The business risks of biodiversity loss will start to materialize with growing intensity,
prompting new, “nature-ﬁrst” startups to enter the most affected industries.■
The damaged credibility of voluntary carbon offsets will hike the cost of offsetting
as a climate action tool, strengthening the business case for decarbonization
measures.■
Greenwashing will enter the corporate mainstream as a formally deﬁned business
risk, adding new rigor to sustainability commitments and, ultimately, strengthening
public trust in them.■

Recommendations
Executive leaders tasked with the responsibility for sustainability performance should:
Strategic Planning Assumptions
By 2026, 50% of G20 members will experience monthly electricity rationing, turning
energy-aware operations into either a competitive advantage or a major failure risk.
By 2027, global enterprises will see the cost of water in the value chain, on average,
double, driving more sophisticated water planning.
By 2027, the companies vulnerable to biodiversity loss will report, on average, 10%
declines in cash ﬂows, triggering investments in nature-ﬁrst competitors.
Through 2028, voluntary carbon offsets will deliver only 20% of their designated climate
impact, forcing accelerated decarbonization among the involved companies.
By 2027, 20% of the S&P 500 will cite greenwashing as a risk factor in 10-K reports,
strengthening rigor in sustainability commitments.Improve the organization’s energy resilience by conducting energy stress tests,
initiating energy efﬁciency programs and investing in intelligent operational tools,
especially energy management and optimization systems.■
Adapt to the water constraints by assessing water risks more systematically,
developing new metrics to track water security and deploying water conservation
measures with business cases that reﬂect the true cost of water resources.■
Prepare the organization for the effects of accelerating biodiversity loss by
incorporating the newly available frameworks and targets for risk management and
launching initiatives that add elements of the nature-ﬁrst paradigm to business.■
Strengthen corporate climate action by scaling down or suspending the use of
voluntary carbon offsets for the time being, ramping up decarbonization measures
and adjusting net-zero plans if the changes in strategy make the current path
unattainable.■
Prevent greenwashing risks by integrating their tracking into enterprise risk
management, educating stakeholders in different functions on the dangers of
unsubstantiated sustainability claims and bolstering current sustainability
commitments with matching levels of investment.■

Analysis
What You Need to Know
During 2023, the business implications of sustainability continued to become more
tangible than they had been a year earlier. Many enterprises face new regulations, and
even the ones that do not are ﬁnding that their customers and investors pay attention to
sustainability, often more methodically than they once did. Governmental subsidies that
are becoming available to speed up energy transition and decarbonization are another
reason that sustainability has gained greater business relevance.
This year’s Sustainability Predicts research highlights ﬁve distinct thematic developments
that will contribute to the trend during the next three to four years. Three of them focus on
access to certain resources, whereas two concern the integrity of sustainability
governance:
Each of these ﬁve developments is a cause for concern in its own right. The fact that a
growing number of countries will become unable to guarantee a constant supply of
electricity will have not only business costs, but human costs as well. Water scarcity will
reach places that have not experienced it before, and are, as a result, ill-prepared for it.
Biodiversity loss frightens by its sheer irreversibility: the effects of a species disappearing
from an area are often discovered only when it is too late to act. Learning that carbon
offset projects are not living up to their promise means that the journey to net zero will
take even longer than ﬁrst thought. And the growing awareness of greenwashing risks
reﬂects, more than anything, how rampant greenwashing really is in the corporate world.
All ﬁve developments may lead to business and societal crises that have some form of
sustainability failure as their root cause. Such crises may cause serious disruptions to
companies and governments.Widespread electricity rationing ■
Persistent water scarcity ■
Escalating biodiversity loss ■
Credibility crisis in voluntary carbon offsets ■
Risks from corporate greenwashing ■

At the same time, Gartner expects the same crises to pave the way for innovations and
behavior changes that will change things for the better in the long term. To help envision
these possibilities, we predict certain implications across all ﬁve themes:
Figure 1 summarizes both aspects of the ﬁve predictions.Enterprises and national economies will have stronger incentives to invest in
capabilities that enable them to thrive amid the volatility of the energy transition.■
Once more companies accept water scarcity as “the new normal,” the methods to
account and prepare for water-related costs and risks will develop rapidly.■
Business shocks from losing nature as an asset, and the public policies to mitigate
them, will be so big that they will create markets for new companies with fewer
dependencies and impacts on nature.■
As low-quality offsets become less acceptable and high-quality ones become more
expensive, enterprises will give a higher priority to measures that reduce greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions.■
The formalization of greenwashing as a business risk with legal consequences is a
prerequisite for better governance, which, in turn, will strengthen public trust in
corporate sustainability.■

Figure 1: Five Predictions on Sustainability
Executive leaders should anticipate how the predicted developments may affect their
organizations and then take the initiative on their implications. The organizations that
invest in relevant capabilities early enough will ﬁnd opportunities in the involved crises.
The ones that do not may be left with only the crises.

Strategic Planning Assumptions
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2026, 50% of G20 members will experience monthly
electricity rationing, turning energy-aware operations into either a competitive advantage
or a major failure risk.
Analysis by: Lloyd Jones, Aapo Markkanen, Kristin Moyer, Lauren Wheatley, Sarah Watt,
Bob Johnson
Key Findings:
Near-Term Flag:
Market Implications:An aging grid infrastructure is limiting the ability to add electricity-generating
capacity; however, demand for electricity continues to increase faster than
capacity.1 Examples include Japan, Israel, South Africa and the U.S. (Texas).2■
Electricity system operators will initially ration electricity through nudging principles,
paying consumers to use less, and then shifting to more-draconian measures of
power cuts, with rotational load shedding.■
Enterprises are assessing energy price and availability as a competitiveness and
business continuity risk. Business leaders are responding by creating energy-aware
operations through optimization, consumption management and direct investment
in energy generation.3■
Electricity allocation will focus on essential services. The availability of electricity for
digital services is not guaranteed. Data center moratoria will expand. Examples
include Ireland, Singapore and the Netherlands.4■
Capacity auctions and the expansion of renewable-energy generation are facing
challenges as a result of government policies that drive low auction prices and do
not align with the increasing costs borne by developers. These rising costs are
primarily driven by high interest rates and weakening supply chains.5,6■

Energy customers value affordability, acceptability and availability. However, electricity
prices have become volatile, triggered by supply constraints. Forty-ﬁve percent of surveyed
business leaders across North America, Europe and Asia agreed that increases in energy
costs in their operations is affecting business viability, as opposed to being tolerated by
the business. In response, organizations will:
Recommendations:
Related Research:Deploy digital technology to create energy-aware, intelligent operations to
automatically adapt production to signals of electricity supply constraints, price
spikes and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is enabled by investment in
energy management and optimization solutions.7■
Make direct investment in energy-generating hardware. With investments in self-
generation and energy communities, enterprises will become empowered and active
participants in the energy system, changing their relationship with electric utilities.■
Stable access to electricity will become a competitive advantage. The business
beneﬁts of operating in geographical locations that offer secure access to low-
carbon energy and sufﬁcient supply will drive competitiveness, causing businesses
to consider relocating operations.■
Use digital technology to collect data (energy consumption, emissions and cost)
throughout the enterprise. Use these insights to make informed energy decisions and
create resilient mitigation plans.■
Conduct energy stress tests across your enterprise and supply chain. Model potential
costs from electricity rationing and supply, operations, and customer failures, and
use the ﬁndings to create risk mitigation plans.■
Leverage energy efﬁciency to establish long-term competitive advantage by
structurally reducing energy consumption. Assess enterprise investments by
including current and future anticipated costs of energy and carbon.■
Deploy intelligent operational tools, such as energy management and optimization
systems, to secure production and reduce operational costs.■
Invest in operational autonomy by scaling intelligent industrial assets and self-
generation to maximize the value of energy management and production.■

Maverick Research: Net Zero Will Stall Tech Growth and Innovation
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2027, global enterprises will see the cost of water in
the value chain, on average, double, driving more-sophisticated water planning.
Analysis by: Bettina Tratz-Ryan, Janel Everly, Sarah Watt, Lauren Wheatley
Key Findings:
Near-Term Flag: As governments in all parts of the world continue to adapt to climate
change, they are likely to place new restrictions on how much water can be extracted for
irrigation, as well as require investments in water-efﬁcient equipment. Speciﬁcally,
droughts in recent years have affected the agricultural sector particularly acutely, through
constrained irrigation capacity. The manufacturing industry can be expected to face
similar regulatory action, especially in food and beverage.Water affects an enterprise’s bottom line through multiple channels. Physical water
risks (quality and quantity) affect operational expenditures, while regulatory and
reputational risks will have an impact on revenue.■
Water usage costs and risks are often poorly managed in most enterprises, and
across their ecosystems, with only a minority accurately valuing the true cost and
liability of water to their business.■
There can be an information deﬁcit for stakeholders on the reporting of material
water-related ﬁnancial risks and opportunities in mainstream corporate reporting,
preventing investors from allocating capital in a way that would instigate change
effectively.■
Water-related opportunities linked to efﬁciency, markets, products, services and
resilience can have a substantive positive ﬁnancial or strategic impact on
enterprises.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00801289 Page 9 of 21
Another newer area where water risks have started to materialize is shipping. During the
droughts of 2022, Germany began restricting commercial access to several rivers, and in
2023, the authority overseeing Panama Canal took similar measures. The spreading of
water risks to new industries and regions will make it more difﬁcult for enterprises to
prepare for them.
Market Implications:
Water scarcity disrupts supply chains, potentially halting production and distribution. This
will affect availability, the prices of raw materials and global trade routes. Enterprises will
bear the costs for securing alternative water sources, adopting efﬁcient technologies and
meeting stringent regulations. In addition, the risks associated with water may lead to
increased insurance premiums or make it difﬁcult for speciﬁc regions or assets to obtain
insurance coverage. Highly water-intensive business activities may also lead to higher
costs of capital.
In response, techniques to plan water replenishment and clean water initiatives, and to
conduct more advanced water accounting, will start quickly evolving as a professional
discipline, along with organizational capabilities. This corporate water planning will
progress under such areas as:
Recommendations:Management of future and current costs of water liabilities to the enterprise, from
operations and across the value chain, including water withdrawal and discharge.■
Incorporation of water risk and opportunity screening for corporate projects to
ensure continued access to capital.■
Improved transparency and disclosures around water practices, in line with growing
regulatory requirements (Note 1) and stakeholder pressure.■
Mitigation of enterprise risks by depreciating water-intensive assets over shorter time
periods.■
Availability of national programs in which federal grants and ﬁnancial assistance for
water conservation and innovation through loans, credit, guarantees or direct
spending/beneﬁts, contingent on following good water accounting practices.■

Quick Answer: How to Meet a Net Positive Water Commitment
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2027, the companies vulnerable to biodiversity loss
will report 10% declines in cash ﬂows, triggering investments in nature-ﬁrst competitors.
Analysis by: Anne Michelle Avolio, Janel Everly, Heather Wheatley
Key Findings:Build investor trust by developing a water-related risk evaluation of business and
supply chain impacts that links directly to ﬁnancial impact mitigation. Apply
organizational primary and value-added water cost in such tools as the World
Wildlife Fund’s Water Risk Filter or the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water
Risk Atlas.■
Strategically explore opportunities to establish long-term competitive advantage by
evaluating water conservation investments in line with the enterprise's risk appetite
for investment and the true cost of water to the enterprise.■
Improve enterprise oversight by including water security metrics in key performance
indicators (KPIs) tied to executive remuneration.■
Nature provides ecosystem services — e.g., food production, fresh water, crop
pollination, forests’ carbon capture and zoonotic disease control. This is critical to a
wide range of economic activities and accounts for more than 50% of the global
GDP, according to an estimate by the World Economic Forum.8 Biodiversity is the
key indicator of nature’s health and resilience.■
Enterprises in a wide range of industries depend directly, or through their supply
chains, on nature and the consumption of its ecosystem services, making them
vulnerable to biodiversity loss. Affected industries include agriculture, forestry, food
and beverage, and travel and tourism. The European Central Bank has estimated
that 75% of all bank loans in the European Union (EU) are provided to companies
that are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service.9■
There are also enterprises that do not depend on ecosystem services, but have a
detrimental impact on biodiversity. Thus, they are vulnerable to regulations aiming to
preserve it. They can be found in such industries as construction and real estate,
mining and metals, and chemicals.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00801289 Page 11 of 21
Near-Term Flag: The Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)
framework, which looks to harmonize how enterprises disclose risks and opportunities
that arise from nature, will drive a more methodical and systematic assessment of such
business issues. At the same time, various environmental regulations will constrain
nature-intensive industries worldwide. In the Netherlands, a national strategy to tackle
nitrogen has led to signiﬁcantly lower speed limits, restrictions on construction and
targets for reducing livestock.11
These measures are already affecting businesses; however, they also act as a source of
competitive advantage for ones that adapt to them better than their peers. Going forward,
the European Union’s (EU’s) new mandate for the member states to restore natural
habitats in 30% of their land and sea areas is set to reshape the relationship between
business and nature.
Market Implications:The nature-ﬁrst company represents a different business paradigm. This type of
enterprise addresses its nature-related dependencies and impact on biodiversity and
nature’s services. It also seeks opportunities by securing ecosystem services for
others. The WEF estimates that nature-positive opportunities in land/food/ocean
use, the built environment, energy and materials extractions could be worth $10
trillion.10■
Companies that minimize their dependencies and align with the nature-ﬁrst
paradigm will be positioned to take advantage of new business opportunities, shifts
in the job market, and increasing ﬁnancing and capital.■
The competitiveness of companies unable to reduce their exposure to nature-related
risk and dependencies will erode due to regulatory action, changing consumer
preferences, higher operating costs, negative cash ﬂows and an increased risk proﬁle
for investment.■
Private capital will be deployed at scale for companies that forecast long-term value
creation through biodiversity-positive products and services, as long as risk-adjusted
return on investment (ROI) is competitive.■
Both acute and chronic physical impacts from biodiversity loss in ecosystem
services, such as pollination, ﬁsh stocks and soils, will affect the global production
of food and other commodities, contributing to inﬂation.■

Strategic Planning Assumption: Through 2028, voluntary carbon offsets will deliver only

involved companies.
Analysis by: Aapo Markkanen, Tsuneo Fujiwara, Chet Geschickter
Key Findings:Biodiversity loss happens gradually, but with fast and visible inﬂection points
concerning speciﬁc locations.That dynamic will make the risks and opportunities
materialize over a shorter time period than what has so far been the case with
climate change, which involves more incremental and less attributable business
impacts.■

related material priorities, by leveraging the guidance in the TNFD framework.■
Minimize risk by developing a plan, as part of enterprise risk mitigation and
management, to reduce resource intensity based on the assessment of the value of
raw materials and related dependencies in the value chain.■

Near-Term Flag: Doubts over measuring offset impacts are not new, but they reached an
inﬂection point in 2023. An extensive journalistic investigation by The Guardian, Die Zeit
and SourceMaterial into measurement standards of Verra, an offset certiﬁcation body,
caused a credibility crisis that extends to any organization that has used offsets on a
signiﬁcant scale. For instance, any product or service that has been marketed as “carbon-
neutral” or “climate-friendly” on the basis of its emissions being offset may be deemed as
a case of false advertising. New laws that aim to speciﬁcally target greenwashing, like the
Green Claims Directive proposed in the EU, are likely to make such practices easier to
target through legal action.
Market Implications:Voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs) have been an integral part of many enterprises’
sustainability strategies, but measuring the real-world impact of VCO schemes is
notoriously difﬁcult.■
Stakeholder concerns over the efﬁcacy of the projects that generate VCOs are
growing, and, at the same time, laws to counter greenwashing make reputational
risks become legal risks.■
The methodological basis of offsetting can be expected to improve in the long term,
but exactly when large-enough advances may materialize is uncertain.■
Methodologically sound offsets from high-quality projects do exist, but are more
expensive — with their prices reﬂecting the high cost of delivering proven CO2
removal from the atmosphere.■
Enterprises cannot base their net-zero plans as much on VCOs as they had intended,
leaving them to choose between scaled-back plans or more-aggressive
decarbonization measures.■
Weakening climate commitments may invite scrutiny and backlash, so many
enterprises are likely to at least speed up decarbonization somewhat in their
operations and value chains.■
High-quality, demonstrably impactful VCOs remain viable sustainability measures,
but they are in short supply. Thus, they are more expensive, which lowers the relative
cost of decarbonization.■
Increasing the supply of high-quality VCOs requires methodological advances, as
well as technological ones in carbon removal techniques and impact measurement.■

How to Effectively Navigate 3 Common Voluntary Carbon Offset Risks
Quick Answer: How Do We Assure the Quality of Voluntary Carbon Offset Purchases?
Strategic Planning Assumption: By 2027, 20% of the S&P 500 will cite greenwashing as a
risk factor in 10-K reports, strengthening rigor in sustainability commitments.
Analysis by: John Blake, Alan Antin, Melanie O’Brien
Key Findings:Carbon insetting — in which the organization funds projects directly related to its
products or value chain — is likely to gain popularity, as enterprises seek alternatives
to offsetting.■
Mitigate the organization’s reputation, legal and ﬁnancial risks by scaling back or
suspending the ongoing investments in any VCO schemes without a sound
methodological basis.■
Persuade internal stakeholders to expedite decarbonization initiatives that directly
reduce emissions, such as energy efﬁciency, renewable energy and sustainable
product design.■
Protect the net-zero plans’ credibility by adjusting any time-bound targets that have
relied on defunct VCOs and cannot be reinforced through decarbonization or high-
quality offsets.■
Support the advancement of offsets by investing in projects that involve key
enablers, such as engineering-based carbon removal or scientiﬁc measurement of
nature-based schemes.■
Engage in carbon insetting cautiously, backed by careful due diligence. Be aware
that such projects can also suffer from methodological ﬂaws and poor governance.■

Near-Term Flag: The citing of greenwashing as a ﬁnancial risk factor in 10-K ﬁlings of the
companies in the S&P 500 in the years prior to 2021 was a very rare occurrence. However,
in 2022, that number rose to ﬁve companies or 1%, citing the risk of greenwashing, and, in
2023,13 that number almost tripled. With commonly used sustainability milestones of
2025 and 2030 approaching, the slow progress14 demonstrated by many enterprises is
likely to expose more of them to this type of risk. For example, according to a study by
CDP, only 3% of the organizations that have submitted a transition plan on how to adapt
to climate change have the appropriate ﬁnancial considerations to support the plan’s
execution.15
Market Implications:Sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) regulation extend to
the functions of marketing and communications, requiring companies to become
more cautious about the commitments they make in the public domain.■
Promises made are increasingly being called into account by nongovernmental
organizations, investors, customers and government agencies, causing reputational
and ﬁnancial risks.12■
Organizations are struggling to deliver on sustainability commitments. This is due to
an early focus on adopting targets for public relations purposes, growth interfering
with goals, misjudging the challenges of optimizing operations, and pushback
against illegitimate offsetting and carbon credit programs.■
Enterprises have to act on their ESG commitments, or they may face ﬁnancial
repercussions. In the U.S., such material risks are documented annually in the Form
10-K report, which serves a comprehensive overview of the business and ﬁnancial
conditions affecting the company.■
Shareholder proposal submissions related to ESG have been rising steadily since
2020, demonstrating increased shareholder desire to escalate matters and interact
with boards of directors to pressure organizations to fulﬁll their ESG commitments.■
Governance and oversight of sustainability data will need to improve, because
enterprises still commonly submit nonﬁnancial data in annual reports without the
sufﬁcient tests and controls that ﬁnancial data requires.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00801289 Page 16 of 21
Recommendations:Increased proxy voting16 related to ESG will reveal continued misalignment between
shareholder demands and company actions. Shareholder scrutiny will increase as
we get closer to 2030, a year that many companies see as the ﬁnish line or as an
interim checkpoint for their sustainability goals.■
In its most severe form, greenwashing may constitute a type of fraud that carries
legal repercussions:■
To mitigate such legal risks, some enterprises will revise their sustainability
targets downwards or even withdraw their sustainability commitments
altogether.■
Other enterprises will maintain their commitments and targets, but will have to
set aggressive budgets to deliver the related initiatives.■
As a whole, sustainability governance will strengthen: More companies will publicize
commitments and targets that they can realistically meet, and avoid ones they
cannot. This increased rigor will also improve public trust in corporate sustainability.■
Excessive aversion of greenwashing risks may lead to “greenhushing”: a practice in
which the organization avoids any communications of its sustainability
achievements.■
Update enterprise risk management to reﬂect greenwashing risks by incorporating
changing regulations and informal pressure points into the risk assessments,
including, for example, integrated risk assessments and fraud prevention controls for
data accuracy and target setting.■
Mitigate greenwashing risks by being more deliberate in goal setting through such
practices as science-based targets and establish guidelines on the responsible use
of sustainability messages in marketing and communications.■
Develop a communication strategy to prepare key executives who will be on the
frontline of explaining these risks, as well as sustainability plan changes to media,
NGOs, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders.■
Develop a ﬁnancially informed transition plan that includes time-bound ﬁnancial
planning, detail on how the plan will affect business strategy, scenario analysis,
assured data and ties to material issues facing the organization.■

A Look Back
In response to your requests, we are taking a look back at some key predictions from
previous years. We have intentionally selected predictions from opposite ends of the scale
— one where we were wholly or largely on target, as well as one we missed.
On Target: 2022 Prediction — Through 2026, scope 3 emissions data availability and
quality will continue to signiﬁcantly constrain the effectiveness of supply chain emission
reduction programs.
By all counts, the difﬁculties in calculating scope 3 emissions continue to hinder
decarbonization efforts in industries involving complex supply chains. If anything, in
2023, these difﬁculties became even more visible to enterprises than they were at the time
of our prediction. For example, a survey by Capgemini Research Institute17 found that,
this year, only 51% of the participating executives agreed with the statement: “We are able
to measure and collect data on our scope 3 emissions.” In the equivalent survey in 2022,
the share was still 60% of the respondents.
Gartner expects the problems with data availability and quality to persist for another
couple of years; however, the building blocks for potentially rapid improvement later on
are also starting to appear. The deployment of carbon accounting and management tools
— sometimes dedicated exclusively to scope 3 — is likely to make a difference.Do not allow the management and mitigation of greenwashing risks to become
greenhushing, because that would undermine the organization’s internal ROI on
sustainability, as well as its contribution to external best practices and sustainability
leadership.■
This research note is restricted to the personal use of rawhad@asu.edu. Gartner, Inc. | G00801289 Page 18 of 21
Another bright spot in 2023 was the growing attention to life cycle analysis (LCA), often
intended to improve the granularity of carbon accounting through product-level emissions.
This push for granularity is likely to become a longer trend. According to Gartner’s
Sustainable Procurement Pulse Survey, 36% of procurement leaders are using data on
product-level emissions today, while 47% plan to do so during the next three years. One
company’s advancement on LCA can trigger advancement among multiple companies
that it supplies, making virtuous cycles a possibility.
Missed: 2022 Prediction — By 2026, the number of very large global companies with net
zero strategies supported by aligned ﬁnancial plans will double, but 70% will still lack
them.
This prediction would represent only modest near-term progress, but even so, based on the
evidence from 2023, it does not stand a good chance to hit its target. The Net Zero
Stocktake 2023 report by Net Zero Tracker concluded that the percentage of entities
meeting the criteria the organization uses to assess the integrity of net zero strategies had
seen virtually no improvement since 2022.18 For the assessed companies, the percentage
increased only from 3% to 4% during the year. In comparison, the public sector fared no
better. Among states and regions, as well as cities, the six criteria were met by 3% of the
assessed entities, which represented no change at all. Right now, it is hard to picture the
sort of widespread improvement that would take the degree of net-zero integrity close to
what we were predicting earlier.
That being said, there is a path to progress in two of the predictions presented in this
research. First, the cautions over greenwashing may push companies to substantiate their
net zero plans with greater investment — especially if unfounded plans start carrying legal
or ﬁnancial risks. Similarly, the methodological reckoning in carbon offsets may force
them to choose between ofﬁcially delaying their net zero timeframes and ramping up
investment in decarbonization. Some will inevitably choose the former; however,
surprisingly, many may choose the latter.
This prediction is also hostage to the lack of data. Even enterprises that would be inclined
to spend more on net zero may decide not to do so if they do not have conﬁdence in the
outcomes their decisions would lead to. Gaining better data on what drives emissions,
and what would reduce them, can unlock real breakthroughs — and Gartner predicts that it
will.

Evidence
2023 Gartner Sustainable Procurement Pulse Survey. This survey was conducted to
assess the state of sustainable procurement and identify initiatives that can make a
difference and drive positive impact. This research was conducted online from 11 March
through 26 May 2023. In total, 104 respondents were interviewed across North America (n
= 19), Europe (n = 68), Latin America (n = 1), the Middle East and Africa (n = 1), and APAC
(n = 15). Qualifying organizations reported enterprisewide annual revenue for the most
recent ﬁscal year of at least $250 million. Qualiﬁed participants were employed full-time,
had personally led, co-led, or played a role in a sustainable procurement initiative in the
past two years, and were in manager roles or above.
